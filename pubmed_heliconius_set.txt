TI  - Structures related to pheromone storage in alar androconia and the female abdominal 
      scent gland of Heliconius erato phyllis, Heliconius ethilla narcaea, and Heliconius 
      besckei (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Heliconiinae).

AB  - We describe the morphology of alar androconia and the female abdominal scent gland 
      of Heliconius erato phyllis, Heliconius ethilla narcaea, and Heliconius besckei. 
      Androconial scales of Heliconius, which are arranged in overlapping wing bands, 
      release pheromones during courtship, probably through vibratory movements of male 
      wings over the female to induce her to mate. An antiaphrodisiac is produced by 
      glands located in the valves of the male and is transferred during copulation to the 
      yellow dorsal abdominal sac present in the virgin female, causing this sac to emit a 
      scent that reduces the attractiveness of the female for courtship with other males. 
      Stereomicroscopy, SEM, and TEM analyses were conducted to describe the morphology of 
      the internal and external scales and the external abdominal scent sac. The findings 
      revealed different sizes of external androconial scales and an internal group of 
      porous structural vesicles that are probably related to the preservation of internal 
      space, reception and storage of secretions, and elimination of volatiles when the 
      male is actively involved in courtship. Translucent projections on the female 
      abdominal scent sac create open reservoirs for the reception, storage, and emission 
      of antiaphrodisiac volatiles along with stink clubs. Male valve denticles vary in 
      form and probably attach securely to the female sac during mating, thus ensuring 
      secretion transfer. These features are discussed in the context of a comparative 
      analysis.

TI  - Embryogenesis of Heliconius erato (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae): a contribution to the 
      anatomical development of an evo-devo model organism.
PG  - 448-59
LID - 10.1111/dgd.12144 [doi]
AB  - This study reports on the embryogenesis of Heliconius erato phyllis between 
      blastoderm formation and the prehatching larval stage. Syncytial blastoderm 
      formation occurred approximately 2 h after egg laying (AEL) and at about 4 h, the 
      cellular blastoderm was formed. The germ band arose from the entire length of the 
      blastoderm, and rapidly became compacted occupying approximately two-thirds of the 
      egg length. At about 7 h AEL, protocephalon and protocorm differentiation occurred. 
      Continued proliferation of the germ band was followed by penetration into the yolk 
      mass, forming a C-shaped embryo at about 10 h. Approximately 12 h AEL, the gnathal, 
      thoracic and abdominal segments became visible. The primordium of the mouthparts and 
      thoracic legs formed as paired evaginations, while the prolegs formed as paired 
      lobes. At about 30 h, the embryo reversed dorsoventrally. Approximately 32 h AEL, 
      the protocephalon and gnathal segments fused, shifting the relative position of the 
      rudimentary appendages in this region. At about 52 h, the embryo was U-shaped in 
      lateral view and at approximately 56 h, the bristles began evagination from the 
      larval cuticle. Larvae hatched at about 72 h. We found that H. erato phyllis 
      followed an embryonic pattern consistent with long-germ embryogenesis. Thus, we 
      believe that H. erato phyllis should be classified as a long-germ lepidopteran. The 
      study of H. erato phyllis embryogenesis provided a structural glimpse into the 
      morphogenetic events that occur in the Heliconius egg period. This study could help 
      future molecular approaches to understanding the evolution of Heliconius 
      development.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance and genetic relationships of enterococci from siblings and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating bacteria in insects can provide information about 
      host-microorganism-environment interactions. The gut microbial community has a 
      profound effect on different physiological functions of insects. Enterococcus spp. 
      are part of the gut community in humans and other animals, as well as in insects. 
      The presence and antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococci are well studied in 
      different animals; however, data for Heliconius erato phyllis (Lepidoptera: 
      Nymphalidae) do not yet exist. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate 
      the distribution of enterococcal species, their antimicrobial resistance profile and 
      virulence genes, and the genetic relationships between enterococci isolated from 
      fecal samples from sibling and non-sibling H. erato phyllis caterpillars collected 
      from different sites in South Brazil. METHODS: Three H. erato phyllis females were 
      captured (two from a forest fragment and one from an urban area), and kept 
      individually in open-air insectaries. Eggs were collected and caterpillars (siblings 
      and non-siblings) were fed daily with Passiflora suberosa leaves. Fecal samples 
      (n = 12) were collected from fifth-instar caterpillars, inoculated in selective 
      medium, and 15 bacterial colonies were randomly selected from each sample. 
      Enterococci were identified by PCR and MALDI-TOF, analyzed by disk diffusion 
      antimicrobial susceptibility tests, and screened for resistance and virulence genes 
      by PCR. The genetic relationships between the strains were determined using 
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: A total of 178 enterococci strains 
      were identified: E. casseliflavus (74.15%; n = 132), E. mundtii (21.34%; n = 38), E. 
      faecalis (1.12%; n = 2) and Enterococcus sp. (3.37%; n = 6). High rates of 
      resistance to rifampicin (56%) and erythromycin (31%) were observed; 120 (67.41%) of 
      the isolates showed resistance to at least one antibiotic and six (3.37%) were 
      multidrug-resistant.None of the erythromycin-resistant strains was positive for the 
      erm(B) and msrC genes. The virulence genes esp, ace, and gelE were observed in 35%, 
      7%, and 1% of the strains, respectively. PFGE separated the enterococci into 22 
      patterns, four being composed of strains from sibling caterpillars. CONCLUSION: 
      Enterococcus casseliflavus was the dominant species in fecal samples of fifth-instar 
      caterpillars. Resistant enterococci strains may be related to environmental 
      pollution or the resistome. The PFGE analysis showed genetic relationships between 
      some strains, suggesting that the enterococci isolated from fecal samples of the 
      sibling caterpillars might have come from common sources, e.g., via diet (herbivory) 
      and/or vertical transmission (through the egg surface). Further studies will be 
      conducted to better understand the role of Enterococcus in the microbial community 
      of the gastrointestinal tract of these insects, and the mechanisms involved in 
      acquisition and maintenance of enterococci.

TI  - Rampant Genome-Wide Admixture across the Heliconius Radiation.
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evab099 [doi]
LID - evab099
AB  - How frequent is gene flow between species? The pattern of evolution is typically 
      portrayed as a phylogenetic tree, yet gene flow between good species may be an 
      important mechanism in diversification, spreading adaptive traits and leading to a 
      complex pattern of phylogenetic incongruence. This process has thus far been studied 
      mainly among a few closely related species, or in geographically restricted areas 
      such as islands, but not on the scale of a continental radiation. Using a genomic 
      representation of 40 out of 47 species in the genus, we demonstrate that admixture 
      has played a role throughout the evolution of the charismatic Neotropical 
      butterflies Heliconius. Modeling of phylogenetic networks based on the exome 
      uncovers up to 13 instances of interspecific gene flow. Admixture is detected among 
      the relatives of Heliconius erato, as well as between the ancient lineages leading 
      to modern clades. Interspecific gene flow played a role throughout the evolution of 
      the genus, although the process has been most frequent in the clade of Heliconius 
      melpomene and relatives. We identify Heliconius hecalesia and relatives as putative 
      hybrids, including new evidence for introgression at the loci controlling the 
      mimetic wing patterns. Models accounting for interspecific gene flow yield a more 
      complete picture of the radiation as a network, which will improve our ability to 
      study trait evolution in a realistic comparative framework.

TI  - Identification and Composition of Clasper Scent Gland Components of the Butterfly 
      Heliconius erato and Its Relation to Mimicry.
PG  - 3300-3313
LID - 10.1002/cbic.202100372 [doi]
AB  - The butterfly Heliconius erato occurs in various mimetic morphs. The male clasper 
      scent gland releases an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone and additionally contains a 
      complex mixture of up to 350 components, varying between individuals. In 114 samples 
      of five different mimicry groups and their hybrids 750 different compounds were 
      detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Many unknown components 
      occurred, which were identified using their mass spectra, gas 
      chromatography/infrared spectroscopy (GC/IR)-analyses, derivatization, and 
      synthesis. Key compounds proved to be various esters of 3-oxohexan-1-ol and 
      (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol with (S)-2,3-dihydrofarnesoic acid, accompanied by a large variety 
      of other esters with longer terpene acids, fatty acids, and various alcohols. In 
      addition, linear terpenes with up to seven uniformly connected isoprene units occur, 
      e. g. farnesylfarnesol. A large number of the compounds have not been reported 
      before from nature. Discriminant analyses of principal components of the gland 
      contents showed that the iridescent mimicry group differs strongly from the other, 
      mostly also separated, mimicry groups. Comparison with data from other species 
      indicated that Heliconius recruits different biosynthetic pathways in a 
      species-specific manner for semiochemical formation.

LID - 10.1002/ece3.3624 [doi]
AB  - Mating systems have broad impacts on how sexual selection and mate choice operate 
      within a species, but studies of mating behavior in the laboratory may not reflect 
      how these processes occur in the wild. Here, we examined the mating behavior of the 
      neotropical butterfly Heliconius erato in the field by releasing larvae and virgin 
      females and observing how they mated. H. erato is considered a pupal-mating species 
      (i.e., males mate with females as they emerge from the pupal case). However, we 
      observed only two teneral mating events, and experimentally released virgins were 
      almost all mated upon recapture. Our study confirms the presence of some 
      pupal-mating behavior in H. erato, but suggests that adult mating is likely the 
      prevalent mating strategy in this species. These findings have important 
      implications for the role of color pattern and female mate choice in the generation 
      of reproductive isolation in this diverse genus.

AB  - Bright, highly reflective iridescent colours can be seen across nature and are 
      produced by the scattering of light from nanostructures. Heliconius butterflies have 
      been widely studied for their diversity and mimicry of wing colour patterns. Despite 
      iridescence evolving multiple times in this genus, little is known about the genetic 
      basis of the colour and the development of the structures which produce it. 
      Heliconius erato can be found across Central and South America, but only races found 
      in western Ecuador and Colombia have developed blue iridescent colour. Here, we use 
      crosses between iridescent and non-iridescent races of H. erato to study phenotypic 
      variation in the resulting F(2) generation. Using measurements of blue colour from 
      photographs, we find that iridescent structural colour is a quantitative trait 
      controlled by multiple genes, with strong evidence for loci on the Z sex chromosome. 
      Iridescence is not linked to the Mendelian colour pattern locus that also segregates 
      in these crosses (controlled by the gene cortex). Small-angle X-ray scattering data 
      show that spacing between longitudinal ridges on the scales, which affects the 
      intensity of the blue reflectance, also varies quantitatively in F(2) crosses.

AB  - Uncovering phylogenetic patterns of cis-regulatory evolution remains a fundamental 
      goal for evolutionary and developmental biology. Here, we characterize the evolution 
      of regulatory loci in butterflies and moths using chromatin immunoprecipitation 
      sequencing (ChIP-seq) annotation of regulatory elements across three stages of head 
      development. In the process we provide a high-quality, functionally annotated genome 
      assembly for the butterfly, Heliconius erato. Comparing cis-regulatory element 
      conservation across six lepidopteran genomes, we find that regulatory sequences 
      evolve at a pace similar to that of protein-coding regions. We also observe that 
      elements active at multiple developmental stages are markedly more conserved than 
      elements with stage-specific activity. Surprisingly, we also find that 
      stage-specific proximal and distal regulatory elements evolve at nearly identical 
      rates. Our study provides a benchmark for genome-wide patterns of regulatory element 
      evolution in insects, and it shows that developmental timing of activity strongly 
      predicts patterns of regulatory sequence evolution.

TI  - First-generation linkage map of the warningly colored butterfly Heliconius erato.
PG  - 408-17
AB  - We report the first genetic linkage map of Heliconius erato, a species that shows 
      remarkable variation in its warningly colored wing patterns. We use crosses between 
      H. erato and its sister species, H. himera, to place two major color pattern genes, 
      D and Cr, on a linkage map containing AFLP, allozyme, microsatellite and single-copy 
      nuclear loci. We identified all 21 linkage groups in an initial genetic screen of 22 
      progeny from an F1 female x male H. himera family. Of the 229 markers, 87 used to 
      identify linkage groups were also informative in 35 progeny from a sibling backcross 
      (H. himera female x F1 male). With these, and an additional 33 markers informative 
      in the second family, we constructed recombinational maps for 19 of the 21 linkage 
      groups. These maps varied in length from 18.1 to 431.1 centimorgans (cM) and yielded 
      an estimated total length of 2400 cM. The average distance between markers was 23 
      cM, and eight of the 19 linkage groups, including the sex chromosome (Z) and the 
      chromosome containing the Cr locus, contained two or more codominant anchor loci. Of 
      the three potential candidate genes mapped here, Cubitus interruptus (Ci), 
      Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Wingless (Wg), only Ci was linked, although loosely, to a 
      known Heliconius color pattern locus. This work is an important first step for 
      constructing a denser genetic map of the H. erato color pattern radiation and for a 
      comparative genomic study of the architecture of mimicry in Heliconius butterflies.

AB  - Recent studies indicate that relatively few genomic regions are repeatedly involved 
      in the evolution of Heliconius butterfly wing patterns. Although this work 
      demonstrates a number of cases where homologous loci underlie both convergent and 
      divergent wing pattern change among different Heliconius species, it is still 
      unclear exactly how many loci underlie pattern variation across the genus. To 
      address this question for Heliconius erato, we created fifteen independent crosses 
      utilizing the four most distinct color pattern races and analyzed color pattern 
      segregation across a total of 1271 F2 and backcross offspring. Additionally, we used 
      the most variable brood, an F2 cross between H. himera and the east Ecuadorian H. 
      erato notabilis, to perform a quantitative genetic analysis of color pattern 
      variation and produce a detailed map of the loci likely involved in the H. erato 
      color pattern radiation. Using AFLP and gene based markers, we show that fewer major 
      genes than previously envisioned control the color pattern variation in H. erato. We 
      describe for the first time the genetic architecture of H. erato wing color pattern 
      by assessing quantitative variation in addition to traditional linkage mapping. In 
      particular, our data suggest three genomic intervals modulate the bulk of the 
      observed variation in color. Furthermore, we also identify several modifier loci of 
      moderate effect size that contribute to the quantitative wing pattern variation. Our 
      results are consistent with the two-step model for the evolution of mimetic wing 
      patterns in Heliconius and support a growing body of empirical data demonstrating 
      the importance of major effect loci in adaptive change.

AB  - Heliconius butterflies (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) are a group of 48 neotropical 
      species widely studied in evolutionary research. Despite the wealth of genomic data 
      generated in past years, chromosomal level genome assemblies currently exist for 
      only two species, Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius erato, each a representative 
      of one of the two major clades of the genus. Here, we use these reference genomes to 
      improve the contiguity of previously published draft genome assemblies of 16 
      Heliconius species. Using a reference-assisted scaffolding approach, we place and 
      order the scaffolds of these genomes onto chromosomes, resulting in 95.7-99.9% of 
      their genomes anchored to chromosomes. Genome sizes are somewhat variable among 
      species (270-422 Mb) and in one small group of species (Heliconius hecale, 
      Heliconius elevatus, and Heliconius pardalinus) expansions in genome size are driven 
      mainly by repetitive sequences that map to four small regions in the H. melpomene 
      reference genome. Genes from these repeat regions show an increase in exon copy 
      number, an absence of internal stop codons, evidence of constraint on nonsynonymous 
      changes, and increased expression, all of which suggest that at least some of the 
      extra copies are functional. Finally, we conducted a systematic search for 
      inversions and identified five moderately large inversions fixed between the two 
      major Heliconius clades. We infer that one of these inversions was transferred by 
      introgression between the lineages leading to the erato/sara and burneyi/doris 
      clades. These reference-guided assemblies represent a major improvement in 
      Heliconius genomic resources that enable further genetic and evolutionary 
      discoveries in this genus.

      however, most nymphalid genera have limited diversity, with only three or four 
      spectral types of photoreceptor. Here, we examined the spatial pattern of opsin 
      expression and photoreceptor spectral sensitivities in Heliconius erato, a nymphalid 
      with duplicate ultraviolet opsin genes, UVRh1 and UVRh2 We found that the H. erato 
      compound eye is sexually dimorphic. Females express the two UV opsin proteins in 
      separate photoreceptors, but males do not express UVRh1. Intracellular recordings 
      confirmed that females have three short wavelength-sensitive photoreceptors 
      (λmax=356, ∼390 and 470 nm), while males have two (λmax=390 and ∼470 nm). We also 
      found two long wavelength-sensitive photoreceptors (green, λmax∼555 nm, and red, 
      λmax∼600 nm), which express the same LW opsin. The red cell's shifted sensitivity is 
      probably due to perirhabdomal filtering pigments. Sexual dimorphism of the 
      UV-absorbing rhodopsins may reflect the females' need to discriminate conspecifics 
      from co-mimics. Red-green color vision may be used to detect differences in red 
      coloration on Heliconius wings, or for host-plant identification. Among nymphalids 
      so far investigated, only H. erato is known to possess five spectral classes of 
      photoreceptor; sexual dimorphism of the eye via suppression of one class of opsin 
      (here UVRh1 in males) has not - to our knowledge - been reported in any animal.

AB  - Müllerian mimicry strongly exemplifies the power of natural selection. However, the 
      exact measure of such adaptive phenotypic convergence and the possible causes of its 
      imperfection often remain unidentified. Here, we first quantify wing colour pattern 
      differences in the forewing region of 14 co-mimetic colour pattern morphs of the 
      butterfly species Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene and measure the extent 
      to which mimicking colour pattern morphs are not perfectly identical. Next, using 
      gene-editing CRISPR/Cas9 KO experiments of the gene WntA, which has been mapped to 
      colour pattern diversity in these butterflies, we explore the exact areas of the 
      wings in which WntA affects colour pattern formation differently in H. erato and H. 
      melpomene. We find that, while the relative size of the forewing pattern is 
      generally nearly identical between co-mimics, the CRISPR/Cas9 KO results highlight 
      divergent boundaries in the wing that prevent the co-mimics from achieving perfect 
      mimicry. We suggest that this mismatch may be explained by divergence in the gene 
      regulatory network that defines wing colour patterning in both species, thus 
      constraining morphological evolution even between closely related species.

AB  - The unpalatable and warning-patterned butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius 
      melpomene provide the best studied example of mutualistic Müllerian mimicry, 
      thought-but rarely demonstrated-to promote coevolution. Some of the strongest 
      available evidence for coevolution comes from phylogenetic codivergence, the 
      parallel divergence of ecologically associated lineages. Early evolutionary 
      reconstructions suggested codivergence between mimetic populations of H. erato and 
      H. melpomene, and this was initially hailed as one of the most striking known cases 
      of coevolution. However, subsequent molecular phylogenetic analyses found 
      discrepancies in phylogenetic branching patterns and timing (topological and 
      temporal incongruence) that argued against codivergence. We present the first 
      explicit cophylogenetic test of codivergence between mimetic populations of H. erato 
      and H. melpomene, and re-examine the timing of these radiations. We find 
      statistically significant topological congruence between multilocus coalescent 
      population phylogenies of H. erato and H. melpomene. Cophylogenetic historical 
      reconstructions support repeated codivergence of mimetic populations, from the base 
      of the sampled radiations. Pairwise distance correlation tests, based on our 
      coalescent analyses plus recently published AFLP and wing colour pattern gene data, 
      also suggest that the phylogenies of H. erato and H. melpomene show significant 
      topological congruence. Divergence time estimates, based on a Bayesian coalescent 
      model, suggest that the evolutionary radiations of H. erato and H. melpomene 
      occurred over the same time period, and are compatible with a series of temporally 
      congruent codivergence events. Our results suggest that differences in 
      within-species genetic divergence are the result of a greater overall effective 
      population size for H. erato relative to H. melpomene and do not imply incongruence 
      in the timing of their phylogenetic radiations. Repeated codivergence between 
      Müllerian co-mimics, predicted to exert mutual selection pressures, strongly 
      suggests coevolution. Our results therefore support a history of reciprocal 
      coevolution between Müllerian co-mimics characterised by phylogenetic codivergence 
      and parallel phenotypic change.

LID - 10.1111/evo.14272 [doi]
AB  - Hybridizing species provide a powerful system to identify the processes that shape 
      genomic variation and maintain species boundaries. However, complex histories of 
      isolation, gene flow, and selection often generate heterogeneous genomic landscapes 
      of divergence that complicate reconstruction of the speciation history. Here, we 
      explore patterns of divergence to reconstruct recent speciation in the erato clade 
      of Heliconius butterflies. We focus on the genomic landscape of divergence across 
      three contact zones of the species H. erato and H. himera. We show that these 
      hybridizing species have an intermediate level of divergence in the erato clade, 
      which fits with their incomplete levels of reproductive isolation. Using demographic 
      modeling and the relationship between admixture and divergence with recombination 
      rate variation, we reconstruct histories of gene flow, selection, and demographic 
      change that explain the observed patterns of genomic divergence. We find that 
      periods of isolation and selection within populations, followed by secondary contact 
      with asymmetrical gene flow are key factors in shaping the heterogeneous genomic 
      landscapes. Collectively, these results highlight the effectiveness of demographic 
      modeling and recombination rate estimates to disentangling the distinct 
      contributions of gene flow and selection to patterns of genomic divergence.

TI  - Ultraviolet and yellow reflectance but not fluorescence is important for visual 
      discrimination of conspecifics by Heliconius erato.
PG  - 1267-1276
LID - 10.1242/jeb.153593 [doi]
AB  - Toxic Heliconius butterflies have yellow hindwing bars that - unlike those of their 
      closest relatives - reflect ultraviolet (UV) and long wavelength light, and also 
      fluoresce. The pigment in the yellow scales is 3-hydroxy-dl-kynurenine (3-OHK), 
      which is found in the hair and scales of a variety of animals. In other butterflies 
      like pierids with color schemes characterized by independent sources of variation in 
      UV and human-visible yellow/orange, behavioral experiments have generally implicated 
      the UV component as most relevant to mate choice. This has not been addressed in 
      Heliconius butterflies, where variation exists in analogous color components, but 
      moreover where fluorescence due to 3-OHK could also contribute to yellow wing 
      coloration. In addition, the potential cost due to predator visibility is largely 
      unknown for the analogous well-studied pierid butterfly species. In field studies 
      with butterfly paper models, we show that both UV and 3-OHK yellow act as signals 
      for H. erato when compared with models lacking UV or resembling ancestral Eueides 
      yellow, respectively, but attack rates by birds do not differ significantly between 
      the models. Furthermore, measurement of the quantum yield and reflectance spectra of 
      3-OHK indicates that fluorescence does not contribute to the visual signal under 
      broad-spectrum illumination. Our results suggest that the use of 3-OHK pigmentation 
      instead of ancestral yellow was driven by sexual selection rather than predation.

AB  - Usually the literature on Heliconius show three types of scales, classified based on 
      the correlation between color and ultrastructure: type I - white and yellow, type II 
      - black, and type III - orange and red. The ultrastructure of the scales located at 
      the silvery/brownish surfaces of males/females is for the first time described in 
      this paper. Besides, we describe the ontogeny of pigmentation, the scale 
      morphogenesis and the maturation timing of scales fated to different colors in 
      Heliconius erato phyllis. The silvery/brownish surfaces showed ultrastructurally 
      similar scales to the type I, II and III. The ontogeny of pigmentation follows the 
      sequence red, black, silvery/brownish and yellow. The maturation of yellow-fated 
      scales, however, occurred simultaneously with the red-fated scales, before the 
      pigmentation becomes visible. In spite of the scales at the silvery/brownish 
      surfaces being ultrastructurally similar to the yellow, red and black scales, they 
      mature after them; this suggests that the maturation timing does not show a

TI  - Deep Convergence, Shared Ancestry, and Evolutionary Novelty in the Genetic 
      Architecture of Heliconius Mimicry.
PG  - 765-780
LID - 10.1534/genetics.120.303611 [doi]
AB  - Convergent evolution can occur through different genetic mechanisms in different 
      species. It is now clear that convergence at the genetic level is also widespread, 
      and can be caused by either (i) parallel genetic evolution, where independently 
      evolved convergent mutations arise in different populations or species, or (ii) 
      collateral evolution in which shared ancestry results from either ancestral 
      polymorphism or introgression among taxa. The adaptive radiation of Heliconius 
      butterflies shows color pattern variation within species, as well as mimetic 
      convergence between species. Using comparisons from across multiple hybrid zones, we 
      use signals of shared ancestry to identify and refine multiple putative regulatory 
      elements in Heliconius melpomene and its comimics, Heliconius elevatus and 
      Heliconius besckei, around three known major color patterning genes: optix, WntA, 
      and cortex While we find that convergence between H. melpomene and H. elevatus is 
      caused by a complex history of collateral evolution via introgression in the Amazon, 
      convergence between these species in the Guianas appears to have evolved 
      independently. Thus, we find adaptive convergent genetic evolution to be a key 
      driver of regulatory changes that lead to rapid phenotypic changes. Furthermore, we 
      uncover evidence of parallel genetic evolution at some loci around optix and WntA in 
      H. melpomene and its distant comimic Heliconius erato Ultimately, we show that all 
      three of convergence, conservation, and novelty underlie the modular architecture of 
      Heliconius color pattern mimicry.

TI  - Sensing the Plant Surface Prior to Feeding and Oviposition: Differences in External 
      Ultrastructure and Function Among Tarsi of Heliconius erato.
PG  - 85-95
LID - 10.1007/s13744-017-0508-0 [doi]
AB  - Adult foretarsi of Heliconius erato Linnaeus (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae) are reduced 
      in size and are not used for walking. Foretarsi of the female have specialized 
      sensilla that are presumably used to identify the host plant, by drumming. The mid- 
      and hind tarsi also bear sensilla in both sexes, but these have not been described 
      in detail, nor has their chemosensory function been determined. We described and 
      compared the tarsi of H. erato under light and scanning electron microscopy. 
      Behavioral experiments showed that differences in the shape, number, and size of 
      sensilla were related to feeding and oviposition behaviors. Two types of sensillum 
      (chaeticum and trichodeum) were found in similar numbers and size on the mid- and 
      hind tarsi of both sexes. Sensilla on the female foretarsi act in host-plant site 
      selection, strongly affecting oviposition rates when isolated. Male foretarsi lack 
      sensilla, which may have been selected against due to the absence of function and 
      thus lost. Sensilla on the mid- and hind tarsi are involved in sugar detection in 
      both sexes, responding to an effective dose of sucrose (ED(50)) near 0.01 M, and 
      therefore might be used to identify food resources when the butterflies settle on 
      flowers.

TI  - True UV color vision in a female butterfly with two UV opsins.
LID - jeb242802 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.242802 [doi]
AB  - In true color vision, animals discriminate between light wavelengths, regardless of 
      intensity, using at least two photoreceptors with different spectral sensitivity 
      peaks. Heliconius butterflies have duplicate UV opsin genes, which encode 
      ultraviolet and violet photoreceptors, respectively. In Heliconius erato, only 
      females express the ultraviolet photoreceptor, suggesting females (but not males) 
      can discriminate between UV wavelengths. We tested the ability of H. erato, and two 
      species lacking the violet receptor, Heliconius melpomene and Eueides isabella, to 
      discriminate between 380 and 390 nm, and between 400 and 436 nm, after being trained 
      to associate each stimulus with a sugar reward. We found that only H. erato females 
      have color vision in the UV range. Across species, both sexes show color vision in 
      the blue range. Models of H. erato color vision suggest that females have an 
      advantage over males in discriminating the inner UV-yellow corollas of Psiguria 
      flowers from their outer orange petals. Moreover, previous models ( McCulloch et 
      al., 2017) suggested that H. erato males have an advantage over females in 
      discriminating Heliconius 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-OHK) yellow wing coloration from 
      non-3-OHK yellow wing coloration found in other heliconiines. These results provide 
      some of the first behavioral evidence for female H. erato UV color discrimination in 
      the context of foraging, lending support to the hypothesis ( Briscoe et al., 2010) 
      that the duplicated UV opsin genes function together in UV color vision. Taken 
      together, the sexually dimorphic visual system of H. erato appears to have been 
      shaped by both sexual selection and sex-specific natural selection.

AB  - Heliconius butterflies are known to maximize fitness by feeding on pollen from 
      Gurania sp. and Psiguria sp. (Cucurbitales: Curcurbitaceae), and Psychotria sp. 
      (Gentianales: Rubiaceae). This specialization involves specific physical, 
      physiological, and behavioral adaptations including efficient search strategies in 
      the forest to locate pollen host plants, pollen removal, and pollen external 
      digestion. Reducing pollen host plant search time is crucial to out-compete other 
      flower visitors and to reduce exposure to predators. One way in which this can be 
      achieved is by using chemical cues to learn from experienced foragers in roosting 
      aggregations. Similar strategies have been documented in bumblebees, where 
      inexperienced individuals learn floral odors from experienced foragers. Behavioral 
      experiments using plants preferred by Heliconius erato suggest that pollen 
      preference in H. erato is an innate trait and consequently learning of chemical cues 
      at roosting aggregations is unlikely.

TI  - Dissecting comimetic radiations in Heliconius reveals divergent histories of 
      convergent butterflies.
PG  - 7365-70
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0911572107 [doi]
AB  - Mimicry among Heliconius butterflies provides a classic example of coevolution but 
      unresolved relationships among mimetic subspecies have prevented examination of 
      codiversification between species. We present amplified fragment length polymorphism 
      and mtDNA datasets for the major comimetic races of Heliconius erato and H. 
      melpomene. The AFLP data reveal unprecedented resolution, clustering samples by 
      geography and race in both species. Our results show that, although H. erato and H. 
      melpomene co-occur, mimic each other, and exhibit parallel shifts in color pattern, 
      they experienced very different modes of diversification and geographic histories. 
      Our results suggest that H. erato originated on the western side of South America 
      whereas H. melpomene originated in the east. H. erato underwent rapid 
      diversification and expansion with continued gene-flow following diversification, 
      resulting in widely dispersed sister taxa. In contrast, H. melpomene underwent a 
      slower pace of diversification with lower levels of gene flow, producing a stepwise 
      directional expansion from west to east. Our results also suggest that each of the 
      three main wing pattern phenotypes originated and/or was lost multiple times in each 
      species. The rayed pattern is likely to be the ancestral phenotype in H. erato 
      whereas postman or red patch is likely to be ancestral in H. melpomene. Finally, H. 
      cydno and H. himera are monophyletic entities clearly nested within H. melpomene and 
      H. erato, rather than being their respective sister species. Estimates of mtDNA 
      divergence suggest a minimum age of 2.8 and 2.1 My for H. erato and H. melpomene, 
      respectively, placing their origins in the late Pliocene.

AB  - Cis-regulatory evolution is an important engine of organismal diversification. 
      Although recent studies have looked at genomic patterns of regulatory evolution 
      between species, we still have a poor understanding of the magnitude and nature of 
      regulatory variation within species. Here, we examine the evolution of regulatory 
      element activity over wing development in three Heliconius erato butterfly 
      populations to determine how regulatory variation is associated with population 
      structure. We show that intraspecific divergence in chromatin accessibility and 
      regulatory activity is abundant, and that regulatory variants are spatially 
      clustered in the genome. Regions with strong population structure are highly 
      enriched for regulatory variants, and enrichment patterns are associated with 
      developmental stage and gene expression. We also found that variable regulatory 
      elements are particularly enriched in species-specific genomic regions and long 
      interspersed nuclear elements. Our findings suggest that genome-wide selection on 
      chromatin accessibility and regulatory activity is an important force driving 
      patterns of genomic divergence within Heliconius species. This work also provides a 
      resource for the study of gene regulatory evolution in H. erato and other 
      heliconiine butterflies.

      Heliconius butterflies.

AB  - Identifying the genetic changes driving adaptive variation in natural populations is 
      key to understanding the origins of biodiversity. The mosaic of mimetic wing 
      patterns in Heliconius butterflies makes an excellent system for exploring adaptive 
      variation using next-generation sequencing. In this study, we use a combination of 
      techniques to annotate the genomic interval modulating red color pattern variation, 
      identify a narrow region responsible for adaptive divergence and convergence in 
      Heliconius wing color patterns, and explore the evolutionary history of these 
      adaptive alleles. We use whole genome resequencing from four hybrid zones between 
      divergent color pattern races of Heliconius erato and two hybrid zones of the 
      co-mimic Heliconius melpomene to examine genetic variation across 2.2 Mb of a 
      partial reference sequence. In the intergenic region near optix, the gene previously 
      shown to be responsible for the complex red pattern variation in Heliconius, 
      population genetic analyses identify a shared 65-kb region of divergence that 
      includes several sites perfectly associated with phenotype within each species. This 
      region likely contains multiple cis-regulatory elements that control discrete 
      expression domains of optix. The parallel signatures of genetic differentiation in 
      H. erato and H. melpomene support a shared genetic architecture between the two 
      distantly related co-mimics; however, phylogenetic analysis suggests mimetic 
      patterns in each species evolved independently. Using a combination of 
      next-generation sequencing analyses, we have refined our understanding of the 
      genetic architecture of wing pattern variation in Heliconius and gained important 
      insights into the evolution of novel adaptive phenotypes in natural populations.

TI  - Spectrum of cyanide toxicity and allocation in Heliconius erato and Passiflora host 
      plants.
PG  - 319-29
AB  - The larvae of three races of Heliconius erato were fed various species of Passiflora 
      containing varying levels of cyanoglucosides. The mortality rate of larvae and pupae 
      rose when larvae were fed species of Passiflora capable of releasing larger 
      quantities of cyanide. When larvae were fed species of Passiflora with these 
      properties, the resulting adult butterflies also released higher levels of cyanide. 
      This may serve as a defense mechanism. The compounds responsible for the release of 
      cyanide were not evenly distributed throughout the adult butterfly's body. The 
      thorax contained the highest concentration of cyanogenic substances, followed by the 
      head, wings, and abdomen. The younger tissues of Passiflora plants had higher levels 
      of cyanide-releasing compounds than stems and mature leaves. Cyanogenic glycoside 
      distribution within the plants is consistent with optimal allocation theory. The 
      levels of cyanide-releasing substances in plants varied depending on the season.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A key to understanding the origins of species is determining the 
      evolutionary processes that drive the patterns of genomic divergence during 
      speciation. New genomic technologies enable the study of high-resolution genomic 
      patterns of divergence across natural speciation continua, where taxa pairs with 
      different levels of reproductive isolation can be used as proxies for different 
      stages of speciation. Empirical studies of these speciation continua can provide 
      valuable insights into how genomes diverge during speciation. METHODS: We examine 
      variation across a handful of genomic regions in parapatric and allopatric 
      populations of Heliconius butterflies with varying levels of reproductive isolation. 
      Genome sequences were mapped to 2.2-Mb of the H. erato genome, including 1-Mb across 
      the red color pattern locus and multiple regions unlinked to color pattern 
      variation. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analyses reveal a speciation continuum of pairs of 
      hybridizing races and incipient species in the Heliconius erato clade. Comparisons 
      of hybridizing pairs of divergently colored races and incipient species reveal that 
      genomic divergence increases with ecological and reproductive isolation, not only 
      across the locus responsible for adaptive variation in red wing coloration, but also 
      at genomic regions unlinked to color pattern. DISCUSSION: We observe high levels of 
      divergence between the incipient species H. erato and H. himera, suggesting that 
      divergence may accumulate early in the speciation process. Comparisons of genomic 
      divergence between the incipient species and allopatric races suggest that limited 
      gene flow cannot account for the observed high levels of divergence between the 
      incipient species. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a reconstruction of the 
      speciation continuum across the H. erato clade and provide insights into the 
      processes that drive genomic divergence during speciation, establishing the H. erato 
      clade as a powerful framework for the study of speciation.

TI  - The roles of hybridization and habitat fragmentation in the evolution of Brazil's 
      enigmatic longwing butterflies, Heliconius nattereri and H. hermathena.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heliconius butterflies are widely distributed across the Neotropics and 
      have evolved a stunning array of wing color patterns that mediate Müllerian mimicry 
      and mating behavior. Their rapid radiation has been strongly influenced by 
      hybridization, which has created new species and allowed sharing of color patterning 
      alleles between mimetic species pairs. While these processes have frequently been 
      observed in widespread species with contiguous distributions, many Heliconius 
      species inhabit patchy or rare habitats that may strongly influence the origin and 
      spread of species and color patterns. Here, we assess the effects of historical 
      population fragmentation and unique biology on the origins, genetic health, and 
      color pattern evolution of two rare and sparsely distributed Brazilian butterflies, 
      Heliconius hermathena and Heliconius nattereri. RESULTS: We assembled genomes and 
      re-sequenced whole genomes of eight H. nattereri and 71 H. hermathena individuals. 
      These species harbor little genetic diversity, skewed site frequency spectra, and 
      high deleterious mutation loads consistent with recent population bottlenecks. 
      Heliconius hermathena consists of discrete, strongly isolated populations that 
      likely arose from a single population that dispersed after the last glacial maximum. 
      Despite having a unique color pattern combination that suggested a hybrid origin, we 
      found no genome-wide evidence that H. hermathena is a hybrid species. However, H. 
      hermathena mimicry evolved via introgression, from co-mimetic Heliconius erato, of a 
      small genomic region upstream of the color patterning gene cortex. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Heliconius hermathena and H. nattereri population fragmentation, potentially driven 
      by historical climate change and recent deforestation, has significantly reduced the 
      genetic health of these rare species. Our results contribute to a growing body of 
      evidence that introgression of color patterning alleles between co-mimetic species 
      appears to be a general feature of Heliconius evolution.

TI  - The genetic architecture of adaptation: convergence and pleiotropy in Heliconius 
      wing pattern evolution.
PG  - 138-152
LID - 10.1038/s41437-018-0180-0 [doi]
AB  - Unravelling the genetic basis of adaptive traits is a major challenge in 
      evolutionary biology. Doing so informs our understanding of evolution towards an 
      adaptive optimum, the distribution of locus effect sizes, and the influence of 
      genetic architecture on the evolvability of a trait. In the Müllerian co-mimics 
      Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius erato some Mendelian loci affecting mimicry 
      shifts are well known. However, several phenotypes in H. melpomene remain to be 
      mapped, and the quantitative genetics of colour pattern variation has rarely been 
      analysed. Here we use quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses of crosses between H. 
      melpomene races from Peru and Suriname to map, for the first time, the control of 
      the broken band phenotype to WntA and identify a ~100 kb region controlling this 
      variation. Additionally, we map variation in basal forewing red-orange pigmentation 
      to a locus centred around the gene ventral veins lacking (vvl). The locus also 
      appears to affect medial band shape variation as it was previously known to do in H. 
      erato. This adds to the list of homologous regions controlling convergent phenotypes 
      between these two species. Finally we show that Heliconius wing-patterning genes are 
      strikingly pleiotropic among wing pattern traits. Our results demonstrate how 
      genetic architecture can shape, aid and constrain adaptive evolution.

TI  - Pupal melanization in Heliconius erato phyllis (Lepidoptera; Nymphalidae): genetic 
      and environmental effects.
PG  - 133-40
AB  - This paper deals with estimates of heritability and the effect of two different 
      kinds of environment on the melanization of pupae in the butterfly Heliconius erato 
      phyllis. The results for heritability showed greater differences when the offspring 
      were regressed on male or female values for pupal colour. Pupal colour followed a 
      system of discrete scores, from 2 for the light pupae to 5 for the darkest one. 
      Estimate of the heritability (h2) was 0.44 when the average score of the siblings 
      were regressed on the mid-parental value. When regressed on the male parent, h2 was 
      larger (0.54), being very low when regressed on the female parent (0.09). Estimate 
      by the analysis of variance was also 0.44 when both male and female sibs were 
      included in the analysis (for male sibs, h2=0.43 and for female sibs, 0.47). To test 
      for the effect of the environment, each brood was divided in three, one being the 
      control, the second subjected to a black environment when reaching the fifth instar 
      and the third to a white environment. Those in the black environment originated dark 
      pupae that scored 5 or 4; for those in the white environment, there was no 
      difference with the controls. Caterpillars when entering the prepupal stage were 
      also subjected to the black treatment (early and late prepupal stage, respectively, 
      for treatments called black A and black B). A significant effect was observed only 
      when early prepupal stage was subjected to the black environment.

AB  - Heliconius butterfly wing patterns show repeated convergence between species and 
      have adaptive value in mimicry and mate choice, offering an opportunity to connect 
      adaptive changes in phenotype with their underlying genotypes. Here we study 
      forewing ommochrome pigmentation in Heliconius melpomene. We clone two new 
      ommochrome pathway genes for the Lepidoptera, karmoisin and kynurenine formamidase 
      (kf ), and analyze the expression patterns of all known ommochrome genes across 
      pupal wing development. In combination with published work, this generates the first 
      comparative gene expression data for the co-mimics Heliconius erato and H. 
      melpomene. In both species cinnabar expression correlates with the forewing band, 
      but the expression pattern of vermillion differs significantly between the mimics. 
      This demonstrates that both shared and divergent expression patterns are associated 
      with mimetic phenotypes between Heliconius species. Two genes not studied in H. 
      erato, scarlet and possibly kf, also show enhanced expression in the forewing band 
      of H. melpomene, implying co-ordinated upregulation of several members of this 
      biosynthetic pathway during pattern formation.

AB  - Wing pattern evolution in Heliconius butterflies provides some of the most striking 
      examples of adaptation by natural selection. The genes controlling pattern variation 
      are classic examples of Mendelian loci of large effect, where allelic variation 
      causes large and discrete phenotypic changes and is responsible for both convergent 
      and highly divergent wing pattern evolution across the genus. We characterize 
      nucleotide variation, genotype-by-phenotype associations, linkage disequilibrium 
      (LD), and candidate gene expression patterns across two unlinked genomic intervals 
      that control yellow and red wing pattern variation among mimetic forms of Heliconius 
      erato. Despite very strong natural selection on color pattern, we see neither a 
      strong reduction in genetic diversity nor evidence for extended LD across either 
      patterning interval. This observation highlights the extent that recombination can 
      erase the signature of selection in natural populations and is consistent with the 
      hypothesis that either the adaptive radiation or the alleles controlling it are 
      quite old. However, across both patterning intervals we identified SNPs clustered in 
      several coding regions that were strongly associated with color pattern phenotype. 
      Interestingly, coding regions with associated SNPs were widely separated, suggesting 
      that color pattern alleles may be composed of multiple functional sites, conforming 
      to previous descriptions of these loci as "supergenes." Examination of gene 
      expression levels of genes flanking these regions in both H. erato and its co-mimic, 
      H. melpomene, implicate a gene with high sequence similarity to a kinesin as playing 
      a key role in modulating pattern and provides convincing evidence for parallel 
      changes in gene regulation across co-mimetic lineages. The complex genetic 
      architecture at these color pattern loci stands in marked contrast to the single 
      casual mutations often identified in genetic studies of adaptation, but may be more 
      indicative of the type of genetic changes responsible for much of the adaptive 
      variation found in natural populations.

TI  - A hybrid zone provides evidence for incipient ecological speciation in Heliconius 
      butterflies.

AB  - In Heliconius butterflies, it has been proposed that speciation occurs through a 
      combination of divergence in ecological habitat preferences and mimetic colour 
      patterns. Here we test this hypothesis by investigating a parapatric form of the 
      widespread species Heliconius erato. Mendelian (colour patterns) and molecular 
      genetic data permit us to address hypotheses about introgression and genetic 
      differentiation between different populations. Combined analysis of colour pattern, 
      microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA showed that Heliconius erato venus and 
      Heliconius erato chestertonii form a bimodal hybrid zone implying partial 
      reproductive isolation. In a sample of 121 individuals collected in sympatry, 25% 
      were hybrids representing a significant deficit of heterozygotes compared to the 
      Hardy-Weinberg expectation. Seven microsatellite loci, analysed for a subset of 
      these individuals, showed marked differentiation between the parental taxa, and 
      unambiguously identified two genotypic clusters concordant with our phenotypic 
      classification of individuals. Mitochondrial DNA analysis showed H. erato venus as a 
      monophyletic group well differentiated from H. erato chestertonii, implying a lack 
      of historical introgression between the populations. Heliconius erato chestertonii 
      is therefore an incipient species that maintains its integrity despite high levels 
      of hybridization. Moreover, H. erato chestertonii is found at higher altitudes than 
      other races of H. erato and has a distinct colour pattern and mimetic relationship. 
      Hence, there are now two examples of parapatric incipient species related to H. 
      erato, H. himera and H. erato chestertonii, both of which are associated with higher 
      altitudes, more arid habitats and distinct mimetic relationships. This implies that 
      parapatric habitat adaptation is a likely cause of speciation in this group.

      habitat; Brazil's Atlantic Forest.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1186/1471-2156-12-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brazil's Atlantic Forest is a biodiversity hotspot endangered by severe 
      habitat degradation and fragmentation. Habitat fragmentation is expected to reduce 
      dispersal among habitat patches resulting in increased genetic differentiation among 
      populations. Here we examined genetic diversity and differentiation among 
      populations of two Heliconius butterfly species in the northern portion of Brazil's 
      Atlantic Forest to estimate the potential impact of habitat fragmentation on 
      population connectivity in butterflies with home-range behavior. RESULTS: We 
      generated microsatellite, AFLP and mtDNA sequence data for 136 Heliconius erato 
      specimens from eight collecting locations and 146 H. melpomene specimens from seven 
      locations. Population genetic analyses of the data revealed high levels of genetic 
      diversity in H. erato relative to H. melpomene, widespread genetic differentiation 
      among populations of both species, and no evidence for isolation-by-distance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the extensive 
      habitat fragmentation along Brazil's Atlantic Forest has reduced dispersal of 
      Heliconius butterflies among neighboring habitat patches. The results also lend 
      support to the observation that fine-scale population genetic structure may be 
      common in Heliconius. If such population structure also exists independent of human 
      activity, and has been common over the evolutionary history of Heliconius 
      butterflies, it may have contributed to the evolution of wing pattern diversity in 
      the genus.

TI  - Highly conserved gene order and numerous novel repetitive elements in genomic 
      regions linked to wing pattern variation in Heliconius butterflies.
PG  - 345
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-9-345 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With over 20 parapatric races differing in their warningly colored wing 
      patterns, the butterfly Heliconius erato provides a fascinating example of an 
      adaptive radiation. Together with matching races of its co-mimic Heliconius 
      melpomene, H. erato also represents a textbook case of Müllerian mimicry, a 
      phenomenon where common warning signals are shared amongst noxious organisms. It is 
      of great interest to identify the specific genes that control the mimetic wing 
      patterns of H. erato and H. melpomene. To this end we have undertaken comparative 
      mapping and targeted genomic sequencing in both species. This paper reports on a 
      comparative analysis of genomic sequences linked to color pattern mimicry genes in 
      Heliconius. RESULTS: Scoring AFLP polymorphisms in H. erato broods allowed us to 
      survey loci at approximately 362 kb intervals across the genome. With this strategy 
      we were able to identify markers tightly linked to two color pattern genes: D and 
      Cr, which were then used to screen H. erato BAC libraries in order to identify 
      clones for sequencing. Gene density across 600 kb of BAC sequences appeared 
      relatively low, although the number of predicted open reading frames was typical for 
      an insect. We focused analyses on the D- and Cr-linked H. erato BAC sequences and on 
      the Yb-linked H. melpomene BAC sequence. A comparative analysis between homologous 
      regions of H. erato (Cr-linked BAC) and H. melpomene (Yb-linked BAC) revealed high 
      levels of sequence conservation and microsynteny between the two species. We found 
      that repeated elements constitute 26% and 20% of BAC sequences from H. erato and H. 
      melpomene respectively. The majority of these repetitive sequences appear to be 
      novel, as they showed no significant similarity to any other available insect 
      sequences. We also observed signs of fine scale conservation of gene order between 
      Heliconius and the moth Bombyx mori, suggesting that lepidopteran genome 
      architecture may be conserved over very long evolutionary time scales. CONCLUSION: 
      Here we have demonstrated the tractability of progressing from a genetic linkage map 
      to genomic sequence data in Heliconius butterflies. We have also shown that 
      fine-scale gene order is highly conserved between distantly related Heliconius 
      species, and also between Heliconius and B. mori. Together, these findings suggest 
      that genome structure in macrolepidoptera might be very conserved, and show that 
      mapping and positional cloning efforts in different lepidopteran species can be 
      reciprocally informative.

AB  - The evidence supporting the recent hypothesis of a homoploid hybrid origin for the 
      butterfly species Heliconius heurippa is evaluated. Data from selective breeding 
      experiments, mate-choice studies, and a wide variety of DNA markers are reviewed, 
      and an alternative hypothesis for the origin of the species and its close relatives 
      is proposed. A scenario of occasional red wing-pattern mutations in peripheral 
      populations of Heliconius cydno with subsequent adaptive convergence towards 
      sympatric mimicry rings involving H. melpomene and H. erato is offered as an 
      alternative to the HHS hypothesis. Recent twists of this tale are addressed in a 
      postscript.

LID - 10.1111/jeb.13499 [doi]
AB  - Hybrid zones have long been of interest to biologists as natural laboratories where 
      we can gain insight into the processes of adaptation and speciation. Repeated 
      sampling of individual hybrid zones has been particularly useful in elucidating the 
      dynamic balance between selection and dispersal that maintains most hybrid zones. 
      Here, we revisit a hybrid zone between Heliconius erato butterflies in Panamá for a 
      third time over more than 30 years. We combine a novel Bayesian extension of 
      stepped-cline hybrid zone models with environmental data to understand the genetic 
      and environmental causes of cline dynamics in this species. The cline has continued 
      to move west, likely due to dominance drive, but has slowed and broadened. 
      Environmental analyses suggest that widespread deforestation in Panamá could be 
      leading to decreased avian predation and relaxed selection, causing the observed 
      changes in cline dynamics.

AB  - The natural color pattern of individuals of the unpalatable and mimetic butterfly 
      Heliconius erato was altered to a unique nonmimetic pattern. When returned to 
      natural populations, the nonmimetic individuals remained for shorter periods of time 
      and received more wing damage indicative of predator attacks than did the controls. 
      The results indicate that Müllerian mimicry was functioning to protect the 
      butterflies from predation.

      geographic divergence in their aposematic wing phenotypes. Recent studies suggest 
      that this coincident mosaic results from simultaneous demographic processes shaped 
      by extrinsic forces over Pleistocene climate fluctuations. However, DNA sequence 
      variation at two rapidly evolving unlinked nuclear loci, Mannose phosphate isomerase 
      (Mpi) and Triose phosphate isomerase (Tpi), show that the comimetic species have 
      quite different quaternary demographies. In H. erato, despite ongoing lineage 
      sorting across the Andes, nuclear genealogical estimates showed little geographical 
      structure, suggesting high historical gene flow. Coalescent-based demographic 
      analysis revealed population growth since the Pliocene period. Although these 
      patterns suggest vicariant population subdivision associated with the Andean 
      orogeny, they are not consistent with hypotheses of Pleistocene population 
      fragmentation facilitating allopatric wing phenotype radiation in H. erato. In 
      contrast, nuclear genetic diversity, theta, in H. melpomene was reduced relative to 
      its comimic and revealed three phylogeographical clades. The pattern of coalescent 
      events within regional clades was most consistent with population growth in 
      relatively isolated populations after a recent period of restricted population size. 
      These different demographic histories suggest that the wing-pattern radiations were 
      not coincident in the two species. Instead, larger effective population size (N(e)) 
      in H. erato, together with profound population change in H. melpomene, supports an 
      earlier hypothesis that H. erato diversified first as the model species of this 
      remarkable mimetic association.

TI  - An antiaphrodisiac in Heliconius melpomene butterflies.
PG  - 82-93
AB  - Gilbert (1976) suggested that male-contributed odors of mated females of Heliconius 
      erato could enforce monogamy. We investigated the pheromone system of a relative, 
      Heliconius melpomene, using chemical analysis, behavioral experiments, and feeding 
      experiments with labeled biosynthetic pheromone precursors. The abdominal scent 
      glands of males contained a complex odor bouquet, consisting of the volatile 
      compound (E)-beta-ocimene together with some trace components and a less volatile 
      matrix made up predominately of esters of common C16- and C18-fatty acids with the 
      alcohols ethanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, isobutanol, 1-hexanol, and (Z)-3-hexenol. 
      This bouquet is formed during the first days after eclosion, and transferred during 
      copulation to the females. Virgin female scent glands do not contain these 
      compounds. The transfer of ocimene and the esters was shown by analysis of 
      butterflies of both sexes before and after copulation. Additional proof was obtained 
      by males fed with labeled D-13C6- glucose. They produced 13C-labeled ocimene and 
      transferred it to females during copulation. Behavioral tests with ocimene applied 
      to unmated females showed its repellency to males. The esters did not show such 
      activity, but they moderated the evaporation rate of ocimene. Our investigation 
      showed that beta-ocimene is an antiaphrodisiac pheromone of H. melpomene.

TI  - Localization of Müllerian mimicry genes on a dense linkage map of Heliconius erato.
PG  - 735-57
AB  - We report a dense genetic linkage map of Heliconius erato, a neotropical butterfly 
      that has undergone a remarkable adaptive radiation in warningly colored mimetic wing 
      patterns. Our study exploited natural variation segregating in a cross between H. 
      erato etylus and H. himera to localize wing color pattern loci on a dense linkage 
      map containing amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP), microsatellites, and 
      single-copy nuclear loci. We unambiguously identified all 20 autosomal linkage 
      groups and the sex chromosome (Z). The map spanned a total of 1430 Haldane cM and 
      linkage groups varied in size from 26.3 to 97.8 cM. The average distance between 
      markers was 5.1 cM. Within this framework, we localized two major color pattern loci 
      to narrow regions of the genome. The first gene, D, responsible for red/orange 
      elements, had a most likely placement in a 6.7-cM region flanked by two AFLP markers 
      on the end of a large 87.5-cM linkage group. The second locus, Sd, affects the 
      melanic pattern on the forewing and was found within a 6.3-cM interval between 
      flanking AFLP loci. This study complements recent linkage analysis of H. erato's 
      comimic, H. melpomene, and forms the basis for marker-assisted physical mapping and 
      for studies into the comparative genetic architecture of wing-pattern mimicry in 
      Heliconius.

PG  - 200-4
LID - 10.1038/hdy.2011.3 [doi]
AB  - The comimetic Heliconius butterfly species pair, H. erato and H. melpomene, appear 
      to use a conserved Mendelian switch locus to generate their matching red wing 
      patterns. Here we investigate whether H. cydno and H. pachinus, species closely 
      related to H. melpomene, use this same switch locus to generate their highly 
      divergent red and brown color pattern elements. Using an F2 intercross between H. 
      cydno and H. pachinus, we first map the genomic positions of two novel red/brown 
      wing pattern elements; the G locus, which controls the presence of red vs brown at 
      the base of the ventral wings, and the Br locus, which controls the presence vs 
      absence of a brown oval pattern on the ventral hind wing. The results reveal that 
      the G locus is tightly linked to markers in the genomic interval that controls red 
      wing pattern elements of H. erato and H. melpomene. Br is on the same linkage group 
      but approximately 26 cM away. Next, we analyze fine-scale patterns of genetic 
      differentiation and linkage disequilibrium throughout the G locus candidate interval 
      in H. cydno, H. pachinus and H. melpomene, and find evidence for elevated 
      differentiation between H. cydno and H. pachinus, but no localized signature of 
      association. Overall, these results indicate that the G locus maps to the same 
      interval as the locus controlling red patterning in H. melpomene and H. erato. This, 
      in turn, suggests that the genes controlling red pattern elements may be homologous 
      across Heliconius, supporting the hypothesis that Heliconius butterflies use a 
      limited suite of conserved genetic switch loci to generate both convergent and 
      divergent wing patterns.

TI  - Dispersal and gene flow in a butterfly with home range behavior: Heliconius erato 
      (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae).
PG  - 210-217
LID - 10.1007/BF00384789 [doi]
AB  - Heliconius butterflies have been found to have low rates of dispersal in previous 
      mark-recapture studies, and this lack of movement is due home-range behavior. An 
      experiment on Heliconius erato was designed to investigate movement from the site of 
      pupal eclosion. It was found that most of the movement occurs before the first 
      capture of an individual in a mark-recapture study. After incorporating this early 
      movement, the dispersal parameter, σ, is estimated to be at least 296 m (±30 m 
      jackknifed standard error), and the "neighborhood population size", N, is about 
      50-150 individuals. These estimates of σ and N are more than 2 and 5 times larger, 
      respectively, than estimates based on standard mark-recapture data, though they are 
      small compared with estimates from other butterfly species. Severe limitations of 
      using dispersal experiments to estimate gene flow and neighborhood size are 
      discussed. Genetic data from color pattern loci in hybrid zones and from 
      electrophoresis suggest that, if anything, the estimates of σ and N that I have 
      obtained are still too low. Genetic and dispersal data together show that kin 
      selection is an unlikely mechanism for the evolution of warning color and other 
      supposed altruisms in Heliconius, unless occasional genetic drift is also involved.

TI  - Deep mitochondrial divergence within a Heliconius butterfly species is not explained 
      by cryptic speciation or endosymbiotic bacteria.
PG  - 358
LID - 10.1186/1471-2148-11-358 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cryptic population structure can be an indicator of incipient speciation 
      or historical processes. We investigated a previously documented deep break in the 
      mitochondrial haplotypes of Heliconius erato chestertonii to explore the possibility 
      of cryptic speciation, and also the possible presence of endosymbiont bacteria that 
      might drive mitochondrial population structure. RESULTS: Among a sample of 315 
      individuals from 16 populations of western Colombia, two principal mtDNA clades were 
      detected with 2.15% divergence and we confirmed this structure was weakly associated 
      with geography. The first mtDNA clade included 87% of individuals from northern 
      populations and was the sister group of H. erato members of Andes western, while the 
      second clade contained most individuals from southern populations (78%), which 
      shared haplotypes with an Ecuadorian race of H. erato. In contrast, analysis using 
      AFLP markers showed H. e. chestertonii to be a genetically homogeneous species with 
      no association between mitochondrial divergence and AFLP structure. The lack of 
      congruence between molecular markers suggests that cryptic speciation is not a 
      plausible explanation for the deep mitochondrial divergence in H. e chestertonii. We 
      also carried out the first tests for the presence of endosymbiontic bacteria in 
      Heliconius, and identified two distinct lineages of Wolbachia within H. e. 
      chestertonii. However, neither of the principal mitochondrial clades of H. e. 
      chestertonii was directly associated with the patterns of infection. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      conclude that historical demographic processes are the most likely explanation for 
      the high mitochondrial differentiation in H. e. chestertonii, perhaps due to gene 
      flow between Cauca valley H. e. chestertonii and west Pacific slope populations of 
      H. erato.

TI  - Cryptic genetic and wing pattern diversity in a mimetic Heliconius butterfly.
PG  - 2760-70
LID - 10.1111/mec.12290 [doi]
AB  - Despite rampant colour pattern diversity in South America, Heliconius erato exhibits 
      a 'postman' wing pattern throughout most of Central America. We examined genetic 
      variation across the range of H. erato, including dense sampling in Central America, 
      and discovered a deep genetic break, centred on the mountain range that runs through 
      Costa Rica. This break is characterized by a novel mitochondrial lineage, which is 
      nearly fixed in northern Central America, that branches basal to all previously 
      described mitochondrial diversity in the species. Strong genetic differentiation 
      also appears in Z-linked and autosomal markers, and it is further associated with a 
      distinct, but subtle, shift in wing pattern phenotype. Comparison of clines in wing 
      phenotype, mtDNA and nuclear markers indicate they are all centred on the mountains 
      dividing Costa Rica, but that cline width differs among data sets. Phylogeographical 
      analyses, accounting for this new diversity, rewrite our understanding of mimicry 
      evolution in this system. For instance, these results suggest that H. erato 
      originated west of the Andes, perhaps in Central America, and as many as 1 million 
      years before its co-mimic, H. melpomene. Overall our data indicate that neutral 
      genetic markers and colour pattern loci are congruent and converge on the same 
      hypothesis-H. erato originated in northwest South America or Central America with a 
      'postman' phenotype and then radiated into the wealth of colour patterns present 
      today.

TI  - Patterns of Z chromosome divergence among Heliconius species highlight the 
      importance of historical demography.
PG  - 3852-3872
LID - 10.1111/mec.14560 [doi]
AB  - Sex chromosomes are disproportionately involved in reproductive isolation and 
      adaptation. In support of such a "large-X" effect, genome scans between recently 
      diverged populations and species pairs often identify distinct patterns of 
      divergence on the sex chromosome compared to autosomes. When measures of divergence 
      between populations are higher on the sex chromosome compared to autosomes, such 
      patterns could be interpreted as evidence for faster divergence on the sex 
      chromosome, that is "faster-X", barriers to gene flow on the sex chromosome. 
      However, demographic changes can strongly skew divergence estimates and are not 
      always taken into consideration. We used 224 whole-genome sequences representing 36 
      populations from two Heliconius butterfly clades (H. erato and H. melpomene) to 
      explore patterns of Z chromosome divergence. We show that increased divergence 
      compared to equilibrium expectations can in many cases be explained by demographic 
      change. Among Heliconius erato populations, for instance, population size increase 
      in the ancestral population can explain increased absolute divergence measures on 
      the Z chromosome compared to the autosomes, as a result of increased ancestral Z 
      chromosome genetic diversity. Nonetheless, we do identify increased divergence on 
      the Z chromosome relative to the autosomes in parapatric or sympatric species 
      comparisons that imply postzygotic reproductive barriers. Using simulations, we show 
      that this is consistent with reduced gene flow on the Z chromosome, perhaps due to 
      greater accumulation of incompatibilities. Our work demonstrates the importance of 
      taking demography into account to interpret patterns of divergence on the Z 
      chromosome, but nonetheless provides evidence to support the Z chromosome as a 
      strong barrier to gene flow in incipient Heliconius butterfly species.

AB  - Differences in habitat use can bridge early and late stages of speciation by 
      initiating assortative mating. Heliconius colour pattern races might select habitats 
      over which each pattern confers a relative fitness advantage because signal efficacy 
      of wing patterns can vary by environment. Thus habitat preferences could serve to 
      promote the evolution of mimetic colour patterns for mate choice. Here I compare 
      colour pattern genotype and phenotype frequencies to environmental variation across 
      the H. erato hydara x H. erato erato hybrid zone in French Guiana to determine 
      whether races exhibit habitat preferences. I found that genotype and phenotype 
      frequencies correspond to differences in land cover moreso than to other 
      environmental factors. Temporal shifts in colour pattern genotypes, phenotypes and 
      land cover also were associated at individual sample sites, which further suggests 
      that H. erato races differ in habitat use and that habitat preferences may promote 
      speciation among Heliconius butterflies.

TI  - Combined EST and proteomic analysis identifies rapidly evolving seminal fluid 
      proteins in Heliconius butterflies.
PG  - 2000-13
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msq092 [doi]
AB  - Seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) directly influence a wide range of reproductive 
      processes, including fertilization, sperm storage, egg production, and immune 
      response. Like many other reproductive proteins, the molecular evolution of SFPs is 
      generally characterized by rapid and frequently adaptive evolution. However, the 
      evolutionary processes underlying this often-documented pattern have not yet been 
      confidently determined. A robust understanding of the processes governing SFP 
      evolution will ultimately require identifying SFPs and characterizing their 
      evolution in many different taxa, often where only limited genomic resources are 
      available. Here, we report the first comprehensive molecular genetic and 
      evolutionary analysis of SFPs conducted in Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies). We 
      have identified 51 novel SFPs from two species of Heliconius butterflies (Heliconius 
      erato and Heliconius melpomene) by combining "indirect" bioinformatic and expression 
      analyses of expressed sequence tags from male accessory gland and wing tissues with 
      "direct" proteomic analyses of spermatophores. Proteomic analyses identified fewer 
      SFPs than the indirect criteria but gave consistent results. Of 51 SFPs, 40 were 
      identified in both species but fewer than half could be functionally annotated via 
      similarity searches (Blast, IPRscan, etc.). The majority of annotated Heliconius 
      SFPs were predicted to be chymotrypsins. Comparisons of Heliconius SFPs with those 
      from fruit fly, mosquito, honeybee, and cricket suggest that gene turnover is high 
      among these proteins and that SFPs are rarely conserved across insect orders. 
      Pairwise estimates of evolutionary rates between SFPs and nonreproductive proteins 
      show that, on average, Heliconius SFPs are evolving rapidly. At least one of these 
      SFPs is evolving adaptively (dN/dS > 1), implicating a role for positive selection 
      in this rapid evolution. This work establishes a strong precedent for future 
      research on the causes and consequences of reproductive protein evolution in the 
      Lepidoptera. Butterflies and moths have an extremely rich history of organismal 
      research, which will provide an informative ecological context for further molecular 
      evolutionary investigations.

AB  - Chemical defences against predators underlie the evolution of aposematic coloration 
      and mimicry, which are classic examples of adaptive evolution. Surprisingly little 
      is known about the roles of ecological and evolutionary processes maintaining 
      defence variation, and how they may feedback to shape the evolutionary dynamics of 
      species. Cyanogenic Heliconius butterflies exhibit diverse warning color patterns 
      and mimicry, thus providing a useful framework for investigating these questions. We 
      studied intraspecific variation in de novo biosynthesized cyanogenic toxicity and 
      its potential ecological and evolutionary sources in wild populations of Heliconius 
      erato along environmental gradients, in common-garden broods and with feeding 
      treatments. Our results demonstrate substantial intraspecific variation, including 
      detectable variation among broods reared in a common garden. The latter estimate 
      suggests considerable evolutionary potential in this trait, although predicting the 
      response to selection is likely complicated due to the observed skewed distribution 
      of toxicity values and the signatures of maternal contributions to the inheritance 
      of toxicity. Larval diet contributed little to toxicity variation. Furthermore, 
      toxicity profiles were similar along steep rainfall and altitudinal gradients, 
      providing little evidence for these factors explaining variation in biosynthesized 
      toxicity in natural populations. In contrast, there were striking differences in the 
      chemical profiles of H. erato from geographically distant populations, implying 
      potential local adaptation in the acquisition mechanisms and levels of defensive 
      compounds. The results highlight the extensive variation and potential for adaptive 
      evolution in defense traits for aposematic and mimetic species, which may contribute 
      to the high diversity often found in these systems.

AB  - Butterfly eyes are complex organs that are composed of a diversity of proteins and 
      they play a central role in visual signaling and ultimately, speciation, and 
      adaptation. Here, we utilized the whole eye transcriptome to obtain a more holistic 
      view of the evolution of the butterfly eye while accounting for speciation events 
      that co-occur with ancient hybridization. We sequenced and assembled transcriptomes 
      from adult female eyes of eight species representing all major clades of the 
      Heliconius genus and an additional outgroup species, Dryas iulia. We identified 
      4,042 orthologous genes shared across all transcriptome data sets and constructed a 
      transcriptome-wide phylogeny, which revealed topological discordance with the 
      mitochondrial phylogenetic tree in the Heliconius pupal mating clade. We then 
      estimated introgression among lineages using additional genome data and found 
      evidence for ancient hybridization leading to the common ancestor of Heliconius 
      hortense and Heliconius clysonymus. We estimated the Ka/Ks ratio for each 
      orthologous cluster and performed further tests to demonstrate genes showing 
      evidence of adaptive protein evolution. Furthermore, we characterized patterns of 
      expression for a subset of these positively selected orthologs using qRT-PCR. Taken 
      together, we identified candidate eye genes that show signatures of adaptive 
      molecular evolution and provide evidence of their expression divergence between 
      species, tissues, and sexes. Our results demonstrate: 1) greater evolutionary 
      changes in younger Heliconius lineages, that is, more positively selected genes in 
      the cydno-melpomene-hecale group as opposed to the sara-hortense-erato group, and 2) 
      suggest an ancient hybridization leading to speciation among Heliconius pupal-mating 
      species.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Longwing butterflies, Heliconius sp., also called heliconians, are 
      striking examples of diversity and mimicry in butterflies. Heliconians feature 
      strongly colored patterns on their wings, arising from wing scales colored by 
      pigments and/or nanostructures, which serve as an aposematic signal. RESULTS: Here, 
      we investigate the coloration mechanisms among several species of Heliconius by 
      applying scanning electron microscopy, (micro)spectrophotometry, and imaging 
      scatterometry. We identify seven kinds of colored scales within Heliconius whose 
      coloration is derived from pigments, nanostructures or both. In yellow-, orange- and 
      red-colored wing patches, both cover and ground scales contain wavelength-selective 
      absorbing pigments, 3-OH-kynurenine, xanthommatin and/or dihydroxanthommatin. In 
      blue wing patches, the cover scales are blue either due to interference of light in 
      the thin-film lower lamina (e.g., H. doris) or in the multilayered lamellae in the 
      scale ridges (so-called ridge reflectors, e.g., H. sara and H. erato); the 
      underlying ground scales are black. In the white wing patches, both cover and ground 
      scales are blue due to their thin-film lower lamina, but because they are stacked 
      upon each other and at the wing substrate, a faint bluish to white color results. 
      Lastly, green wing patches (H. doris) have cover scales with blue-reflecting thin 
      films and short-wavelength absorbing 3-OH-kynurenine, together causing a green 
      color. CONCLUSIONS: The pigmentary and structural traits are discussed in relation 
      to their phylogenetic distribution and the evolution of vision in this highly 
      interesting clade of butterflies.

TI  - Estimation of the spontaneous mutation rate in Heliconius melpomene.
PG  - 239-43
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msu302 [doi]
AB  - We estimated the spontaneous mutation rate in Heliconius melpomene by genome 
      sequencing of a pair of parents and 30 of their offspring, based on the ratio of 
      number of de novo heterozygotes to the number of callable site-individuals. We 
      detected nine new mutations, each one affecting a single site in a single offspring. 
      This yields an estimated mutation rate of 2.9 × 10(-9) (95% confidence interval, 1.3 
      × 10(-9)-5.5 × 10(-9)), which is similar to recent estimates in Drosophila 
      melanogaster, the only other insect species in which the mutation rate has been 
      directly estimated. We infer that recent effective population size of H. melpomene 
      is about 2 million, a substantially lower value than its census size, suggesting a 
      role for natural selection reducing diversity. We estimate that H. melpomene 
      diverged from its Müllerian comimic H. erato about 6 Ma, a somewhat later date than 
      estimates based on a local molecular clock.

TI  - Geographical variation in larval host-plant use by Heliconius erato (Lepidoptera: 
      Nymphalidae) and consequences for adult life history.
PG  - 321-32
AB  - Adult body size, one of the most important life-history components, varies strongly 
      within and between Heliconius erato phyllis (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) populations. 
      This study determines if this variation is caused by geographical changes in 
      host-plant used by the larval stage, whose reproductive parameters are influenced by 
      female body size, with estimates of the corresponding heritability. The variation in 
      adult body size was determined together with a survey of passion vine species 
      (Passifloraceae) used by the larvae in seven localities in Rio Grande do Sul State: 
      three located in the urban area of Porto Alegre and Triunfo Counties, two within 
      Eucalyptus plantations (Barba Negra Forest, Barra do Ribeiro County, and Aguas Belas 
      Experimental Station-Viamão County), one in a Myrtaceae Forest (Itapuã State 
      Park-Itapuã County) and one in the Atlantic Rain Forest (Maquiné Experimental 
      Station-Maquiné County). Effects of female body size on fecundity, egg size and egg 
      viability were determined in an outdoor insectary. Size heritability was estimated 
      by rearing in the laboratory offspring of individuals maintained in an insectary. 
      The data showed that adults from populations where larvae feed only upon Passiflora 
      suberosa are smaller than those that feed on Passiflora misera. The larvae prefer P. 
      misera even when the dominant passion vine in a given place is P. suberosa. 
      Fecundity increases linearly with the increase in size of females, but there is no 
      size effect on egg size or viability. Size heritability is null for the adult size 
      range occurring in the field. Thus, the geographical variation of H. erato phyllis 
      adult size is primarily determined by the type, corresponding availability and 
      quality of host-plants used by the larval stage. Within the natural size range of H. 
      erato phyllis, the variation related to this character is not genetically based, 
      thus being part of H. erato phyllis phenotypic plasticity.

TI  - Rapid morphological radiation and convergence among races of the butterfly 
      Heliconius erato inferred from patterns of mitochondrial DNA evolution.
PG  - 6491-5
AB  - The neotropical Heliconius butterflies are famous examples of Müllerian mimicry, due 
      to the diverse array of shared, brightly colored wing patterns that advertise the 
      butterflies' unpalatability. The parallel geographical variation in these patterns 
      within several widespread species has been invoked to support the controversial 
      Pleistocene refugium hypothesis of tropical diversification. However, in no 
      Heliconius species have either evolutionary rates or relationships among 
      geographical races been explicitly examined. I present a phylogenetic hypothesis 
      based on mitochondrial DNA sequences for 14 divergent races of Heliconius erato, 
      which reveals that similar wing patterns have evolved rapidly and convergently 
      within the species. There is a basal split between groups of races from east and 
      west of the Andes, reflecting a vicariant separation at the base of the Pleistocene. 
      Within each of these clades, sequence divergence is very low, and some haplotypes 
      are shared between allopatric races with radically different wing patterns. The 
      topology implies a simultaneous radiation of races in these two areas within the 
      last 200,000 years. Ages for the clades are estimated by comparing sequence 
      divergence to a plot of mitochondrial divergence in several arthropod taxa with 
      independently dated divergence times. This plot is linear and suggests that 
      mitochondrial DNA in arthropods evolves in a clocklike manner, at least initially, 
      when sequence divergence is low.

AB  - Hybrid zones can be valuable tools for studying evolution and identifying genomic 
      regions responsible for adaptive divergence and underlying phenotypic variation. 
      Hybrid zones between subspecies of Heliconius butterflies can be very narrow and are 
      maintained by strong selection acting on color pattern. The comimetic species, H. 
      erato and H. melpomene, have parallel hybrid zones in which both species undergo a 
      change from one color pattern form to another. We use restriction-associated DNA 
      sequencing to obtain several thousand genome-wide sequence markers and use these to 
      analyze patterns of population divergence across two pairs of parallel hybrid zones 
      in Peru and Ecuador. We compare two approaches for analysis of this type of 
      data-alignment to a reference genome and de novo assembly-and find that alignment 
      gives the best results for species both closely (H. melpomene) and distantly (H. 
      erato, ∼15% divergent) related to the reference sequence. Our results confirm that 
      the color pattern controlling loci account for the majority of divergent regions 
      across the genome, but we also detect other divergent regions apparently unlinked to 
      color pattern differences. We also use association mapping to identify previously 
      unmapped color pattern loci, in particular the Ro locus. Finally, we identify a new 
      cryptic population of H. timareta in Ecuador, which occurs at relatively low 
      altitude and is mimetic with H. melpomene malleti.

TI  - Sexually dimorphic gene expression and transcriptome evolution provide mixed 
      evidence for a fast-Z effect in Heliconius.
PG  - 194-204
LID - 10.1111/jeb.13410 [doi]
AB  - Sex chromosomes have different evolutionary properties compared to autosomes due to 
      their hemizygous nature. In particular, recessive mutations are more readily exposed 
      to selection, which can lead to faster rates of molecular evolution. Here, we report 
      patterns of gene expression and molecular evolution for a group of butterflies. 
      First, we improve the completeness of the Heliconius melpomene reference annotation, 
      a neotropical butterfly with a ZW sex determination system. Then, we analyse RNA 
      from male and female whole abdomens and sequence female ovary and gut tissue to 
      identify sex- and tissue-specific gene expression profiles in H. melpomene. Using 
      these expression profiles, we compare (a) sequence divergence and polymorphism; (b) 
      the strength of positive and negative selection; and (c) rates of adaptive 
      evolution, for Z and autosomal genes between two species of Heliconius butterflies, 
      H. melpomene and H. erato. We show that the rate of adaptive substitutions is higher 
      for Z than autosomal genes, but contrary to expectation, it is also higher for 
      male-biased than female-biased genes. Additionally, we find no significant increase 
      in the rate of adaptive evolution or purifying selection on genes expressed in ovary 
      tissue, a heterogametic-specific tissue. Our results contribute to a growing body of 
      literature from other ZW systems that also provide mixed evidence for a fast-Z 
      effect where hemizygosity influences the rate of adaptive substitutions.

LID - e3953
AB  - Sex-specific pheromones are known to play an important role in butterfly courtship, 
      and may influence both individual reproductive success and reproductive isolation 
      between species. Extensive ecological, behavioural and genetic studies of Heliconius 
      butterflies have made a substantial contribution to our understanding of speciation. 
      Male pheromones, although long suspected to play an important role, have received 
      relatively little attention in this genus. Here, we combine morphological, chemical 
      and behavioural analyses of male pheromones in the Neotropical butterfly Heliconius 
      melpomene. First, we identify putative androconia that are specialized brush-like 
      scales that lie within the shiny grey region of the male hindwing. We then describe 
      putative male sex pheromone compounds, which are largely confined to the androconial 
      region of the hindwing of mature males, but are absent in immature males and 
      females. Finally, behavioural choice experiments reveal that females of 
      H. melpomene, H. erato and H. timareta strongly discriminate against conspecific 
      males which have their androconial region experimentally blocked. As well as 
      demonstrating the importance of chemical signalling for female mate choice in 
      Heliconius butterflies, the results describe structures involved in release of the 
      pheromone and a list of potential male sex pheromone compounds.

AB  - Interspecific competition in herbivorous insects remains a controversial issue. To 
      date, many studied systems have not met assumptions of the traditional competition 
      theory, and a new paradigm has been emerging. We examined the behavioral and 
      life-history consequences of common host plant use of Heliconius erato and Dryas 
      iulia (Nymphalidae) in relation to Passiflora suberosa (Passifloraceae). Larvae of 
      the former use the apical portion of this host; the latter is presumably able to 
      explore all plant parts. We assessed host use pattern in relation to leaf age, when 
      reared either alone (D. iulia) or together (D. iulia and H. erato). Larval feeding 
      choice tests with respect to leaf age were performed, and performance was recorded. 
      Observations were made to assess antagonistic behavior of H. erato and D. iulia 
      towards each other, if any. Similarly to H. erato, D. iulia fed on the young leaves 
      significantly more than the mature ones; larvae were not induced to prefer mature 
      leaves. First instars of H. erato used only the apical parts of P. suberosa and 
      displayed aggressive behavior towards D. iulia, which moved to the lower shoot 
      portions. Larval mortality and development time of both species significantly 
      increased when reared together; such performance costs were more pronounced in D. 
      iulia than H. erato. Our study gathers evidences that use of P. suberosa by these 
      heliconian butterflies represent a case of competitive exclusion resulting in niche 
      differentiation, where costs are higher for D. iulia than H. erato.

TI  - Positive selection of a duplicated UV-sensitive visual pigment coincides with wing 
      pigment evolution in Heliconius butterflies.
PG  - 3628-33
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0910085107 [doi]
AB  - The butterfly Heliconius erato can see from the UV to the red part of the light 
      spectrum with color vision proven from 440 to 640 nm. Its eye is known to contain 
      three visual pigments, rhodopsins, produced by an 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal 
      chromophore together with long wavelength (LWRh), blue (BRh) and UV (UVRh1) opsins. 
      We now find that H. erato has a second UV opsin mRNA (UVRh2)-a previously 
      undescribed duplication of this gene among Lepidoptera. To investigate its 
      evolutionary origin, we screened eye cDNAs from 14 butterfly species in the 
      subfamily Heliconiinae and found both copies only among Heliconius. Phylogeny-based 
      tests of selection indicate positive selection of UVRh2 following duplication, and 
      some of the positively selected sites correspond to vertebrate visual pigment 
      spectral tuning residues. Epi-microspectrophotometry reveals two UV-absorbing 
      rhodopsins in the H. erato eye with lambda(max) = 355 nm and 398 nm. Along with the 
      additional UV opsin, Heliconius have also evolved 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine 
      (3-OHK)-based yellow wing pigments not found in close relatives. Visual models of 
      how butterflies perceive wing color variation indicate this has resulted in an 
      expansion of the number of distinguishable yellow colors on Heliconius wings. 
      Functional diversification of the UV-sensitive visual pigments may help explain why 
      the yellow wing pigments of Heliconius are so colorful in the UV range compared to 
      the yellow pigments of close relatives lacking the UV opsin duplicate.

TI  - On the reliability of a simple method for scoring phenotypes to estimate 
      heritability: A case study with pupal color in Heliconius erato phyllis, Fabricius 
      1775 (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae).

AB  - In this paper, two methods for assessing the degree of melanization of pupal exuviae 
      from the butterfly Heliconius erato phyllis, Fabricius 1775 (Lepidoptera, 
      Nymphalidae, Heliconiini) are compared. In the first method, which was qualitative, 
      the exuviae were classified by scoring the degree of melanization, whereas in the 
      second method, which was quantitative, the exuviae were classified by optical 
      density followed by analysis with appropriate software. The heritability (h(2)) of 
      the degree of melanization was estimated by regression and analysis of variance. The 
      estimates of h (2) were similar with both methods, indicating that the qualitative 
      method could be particularly suitable for field work. The low estimates obtained for 
      heritability may have resulted from the small sample size (n = 7-18 broods, 
      including the parents) or from the allocation-priority hypothesis in which pupal 
      color would be a lower priority trait compared to morphological traits and adequate 
      larval development.

      mating systems.
PG  - 592
LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-9-592 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heliconius butterflies possess a remarkable diversity of phenotypes, 
      physiologies, and behaviors that has long distinguished this genus as a focal taxon 
      in ecological and evolutionary research. Recently Heliconius has also emerged as a 
      model system for using genomic methods to investigate the causes and consequences of 
      biological diversity. One notable aspect of Heliconius diversity is a dichotomy in 
      mating systems which provides an unusual opportunity to investigate the relationship 
      between sexual selection and the evolution of reproductive proteins. As a first step 
      in pursuing this research, we report the generation and analysis of expressed 
      sequence tags (ESTs) from the male accessory gland of H. erato and H. melpomene, 
      species representative of the two mating systems present in the genus Heliconius. 
      RESULTS: We successfully sequenced 933 ESTs clustering into 371 unigenes from H. 
      erato and 1033 ESTs clustering into 340 unigenes from H. melpomene. Results from the 
      two species were very similar. Approximately a third of the unigenes showed no 
      significant BLAST similarity (E-value <10-5) to sequences in GenBank's non-redundant 
      databases, indicating that a large proportion of novel genes are expressed in 
      Heliconius male accessory glands. In both species only a third of accessory gland 
      unigenes were also found among genes expressed in wing tissue. About 25% of unigenes 
      from both species encoded secreted proteins. This includes three groups of highly 
      abundant unigenes encoding repetitive proteins considered to be candidate seminal 
      fluid proteins; proteins encoded by one of these groups were detected in H. erato 
      spermatophores. CONCLUSION: This collection of ESTs will serve as the foundation for 
      the future identification and evolutionary analysis of male reproductive proteins in 
      Heliconius butterflies. These data also represent a significant advance in the 
      rapidly growing collection of genomic resources available in Heliconius butterflies. 
      As such, they substantially enhance this taxon as a model system for investigating 
      questions of ecological, phenotypic, and genomic diversity.

      in Heliconius butterflies.
PG  - 571-582
LID - 10.1111/jeb.13027 [doi]
AB  - During speciation across ecological gradients, diverging populations are exposed to 
      contrasting sensory and spatial information that present new behavioural and 
      perceptive challenges. These challenges may be met by heritable or environmentally 
      induced changes in brain function which mediate behaviour. However, few studies have 
      investigated patterns of neural divergence at the early stages of speciation, 
      inhibiting our understanding of the relative importance of these processes. Here, we 
      provide a novel case study. The incipient species pair, Heliconius erato and 
      H. himera, are parapatric across an environmental and altitudinal gradient. Despite 
      ongoing gene flow, these species have divergent ecological, behavioural and 
      physiological traits. We demonstrate that these taxa also differ significantly in 
      brain composition, in particular in the relative levels of investment in structures 
      that process sensory information. These differences are not explained solely by 
      environmentally-induced plasticity, but include heritable, nonallometric shifts in 
      brain structure. We suggest these differences reflect divergence to meet the demands 
      of contrasting sensory ecologies. This conclusion would support the hypothesis that 
      the evolution of brain structure and function play an important role in facilitating 
      the emergence of ecologically distinct species.

AB  - Butterflies are charismatic insects that have long been a focus of biological 
      research. They are also habitats for microorganisms, yet these microbial symbionts 
      are little-studied, despite their likely importance to butterfly ecology and 
      evolution. In particular, the diversity and composition of the microbial communities 
      inhabiting adult butterflies remain uncharacterized, and it is unknown how the 
      larval (caterpillar) and adult microbiota compare. To address these knowledge gaps, 
      we used Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from internal bacterial communities 
      associated with multiple life stages of the neotropical butterfly Heliconius erato. 
      We found that the leaf-chewing larvae and nectar- and pollen-feeding adults of H. 
      erato contain markedly distinct bacterial communities, a pattern presumably rooted 
      in their distinct diets. Larvae and adult butterflies host relatively small and 
      similar numbers of bacterial phylotypes, but few are common to both stages. The 
      larval microbiota clearly simplifies and reorganizes during metamorphosis; thus, 
      structural changes in a butterfly's bacterial community parallel those in its own 
      morphology. We furthermore identify specific bacterial taxa that may mediate larval 
      and adult feeding biology in Heliconius and other butterflies. Although male and 
      female Heliconius adults differ in reproductive physiology and degree of pollen 
      feeding, bacterial communities associated with H. erato are not sexually dimorphic. 
      Lastly, we show that captive and wild individuals host different microbiota, a 
      finding that may have important implications for the relevance of experimental 
      studies using captive butterflies.

AB  - The colorful wing patterns of Heliconius butterflies represent an excellent system 
      in which to study the genetic and developmental control of adaptation and 
      convergence. Using qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization on developing wings of the 
      co-mimic species Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius erato, we have profiled the 
      expression of three candidate genes located in the genomic locus controlling red 
      color pattern variation. We found convergent domains of gene expression in H. 
      melpomene and H. erato associated with red wing elements in the two genes optix and 
      kinesin. During early pupal development of both species, the expression of optix 
      perfectly associated with all red pattern elements whereas that of kinesin was 
      specifically correlated with the presence of the red forewing band. These results 
      provide evidence for the use of these two tightly linked patterning genes, acting 
      together to create convergent wing phenotypes in Heliconius and constituting a 
      hotspot of adaptation.

TI  - Effect of nitrogen on Passiflora suberosa L. (Passifloraceae) and consequences for 
      larval performance and oviposition in Heliconius erato phyllis (Fabricius) 
      (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae).
PG  - 192-200
AB  - The present study examines the influence of nitrogen on growth rates, morphological 
      and nutritional characteristics of Passiflora suberosa L., and the corresponding 
      consequences for Heliconius erato phyllis (Fabricius) growth and oviposition. The 
      treatments consisted of different nitrogen doses (0, 150 and 300 mg L(-1)) applied 
      to the soil. Newly emerged larvae were individually reared in the laboratory (25+/-1 
      degree C) on branches of P. suberosa obtained from plants grown under the three 
      nitrogen levels, and field collected females were submitted to oviposition choice 
      tests. P. suberosa growth rates, leaf area and internode length increased 
      significantly when grown with nitrogen enriched soil. P. suberosa presented 
      significantly greater leaf toughness when grown without nitrogen addition. Leaves of 
      this species also presented lower water content and toughness. Nitrogen addition 
      increased the concentration of nitrogen and potassium on plant leaf tissues. The 
      greater nitrogen concentration on plants did not affect H. erato phyllis larval 
      survival, but led to a reduction in larval development time and increased adult 
      size. Females significantly preferred to lay eggs in plants cultivated in nitrogen 
      enriched soil. This choice was positively correlated with larval performance, which 
      could be a possible explanation for the maintenance of that behaviour, as well as 
      the choice of larger branches as reported in previous studies.

TI  - Evolution of Sex-Biased Gene Expression and Dosage Compensation in the Eye and Brain 
      of Heliconius Butterflies.
PG  - 2120-2134
LID - 10.1093/molbev/msy111 [doi]
AB  - Differences in behavior and life history traits between females and males are the 
      basis of divergent selective pressures between sexes. It has been suggested that a 
      way for the two sexes to deal with different life history requirements is through 
      sex-biased gene expression. In this study, we performed a comparative sex-biased 
      gene expression analysis of the combined eye and brain transcriptome from five 
      Heliconius species, H. charithonia, H. sara, H. erato, H. melpomene and H. doris, 
      representing five of the main clades from the Heliconius phylogeny. We found that 
      the degree of sexual dimorphism in gene expression is not conserved across 
      Heliconius. Most of the sex-biased genes identified in each species are not 
      sex-biased in any other, suggesting that sexual selection might have driven sexually 
      dimorphic gene expression. Only three genes shared sex-biased expression across 
      multiple species: ultraviolet opsin UVRh1 and orthologs of Drosophila 
      Krüppel-homolog 1 and CG9492. We also observed that in some species female-biased 
      genes have higher evolutionary rates, but in others, male-biased genes show the 
      fastest rates when compared with unbiased genes, suggesting that selective forces 
      driving sex-biased gene evolution in Heliconius act in a sex- and species-specific 
      manner. Furthermore, we found dosage compensation in all the Heliconius tested, 
      providing additional evidence for the conservation of dosage compensation across 
      Lepidoptera. Finally, sex-biased genes are significantly enriched on the Z, a 
      pattern that could be a result of sexually antagonistic selection.

TI  - Genomics of altitude-associated wing shape in two tropical butterflies.

AB  - Understanding how organisms adapt to their local environment is central to 
      evolution. With new whole-genome sequencing technologies and the explosion of data, 
      deciphering the genomic basis of complex traits that are ecologically relevant is 
      becoming increasingly feasible. Here, we studied the genomic basis of wing shape in 
      two Neotropical butterflies that inhabit large geographical ranges. Heliconius 
      butterflies at high elevations have been shown to generally have rounder wings than 
      those in the lowlands. We reared over 1,100 butterflies from 71 broods of H. erato 
      and H. melpomene in common-garden conditions and showed that wing aspect ratio, that 
      is, elongatedness, is highly heritable in both species and that elevation-associated 
      wing aspect ratio differences are maintained. Genome-wide associations with a 
      published data set of 666 whole genomes from across a hybrid zone, uncovered a 
      highly polygenic basis to wing aspect ratio variation in the wild. We identified 
      several genes that have roles in wing morphogenesis or wing aspect ratio variation 
      in Drosophila flies, making them promising candidates for future studies. There was 
      little evidence for molecular parallelism in the two species, with only one shared 
      candidate gene, nor for a role of the four known colour pattern loci, except for 
      optix in H. erato. Thus, we present the first insights into the heritability and 
      genomic basis of within-species wing aspect ratio in two Heliconius species, adding 
      to a growing body of evidence that polygenic adaptation may underlie many 
      ecologically relevant traits.

AB  - To what extent population structure favours the establishment of new phenotypes 
      within a species remains a fundamental question in evolutionary studies. By reducing 
      gene flow, habitat fragmentation is a major factor shaping the genetic structuring 
      of populations, favouring isolation of small populations in which drift may rapidly 
      change frequencies of new variants. When these variants provide advantages to 
      individuals, the combined effect of selection and drift can lead to rapid shifts in 
      phenotypes. In a study published in BMC Genetics, Albuquerque de Moura et al. asked 
      whether such a general pattern of population structure can be observed in Heliconius 
      species, which could have strong implication in the evolution of colour pattern 
      diversification in these butterflies. In this commentary we discuss the potential 
      roles of these three processes (drift, selection and dispersal) on the evolution of 
      Heliconius wing patterns in regard to the findings of a common fine-scale population 
      structure within the co-mimetic species H. melpomene and H. erato. Indeed, a general 
      pattern of population subdivision in the history of these two species may have 
      provoked the major phenotypical shifts observed in their wing colour patterns. The 
      suggestion that coupled environmental pressures (counter-selection of dispersal and 
      selection on co-evolved traits) could be responsible for identical genetic 
      differentiation profiles in H. erato and H. melpomene clearly merits further 
      investigations using both detailed population genetic (including landscape genetic) 
      and ecological studies.

TI  - Estimates of selection and gene flow from measures of cline width and linkage 
      disequilibrium in heliconius hybrid zones.
PG  - 921-36
AB  - Hybrid zones can yield estimates of natural selection and gene flow. The width of a 
      cline in gene frequency is approximately proportional to gene flow (sigma) divided 
      by the square root of per-locus selection (square root of s). Gene flow also causes 
      gametic correlations (linkage disequilibria) between genes that differ across hybrid 
      zones. Correlations are stronger when the hybrid zone is narrow, and rise to a 
      maximum roughly equal to s. Thus cline width and gametic correlations combine to 
      give estimates of gene flow and selection. These indirect measures of sigma and s 
      are especially useful because they can be made from collections, and require no 
      field experiments. The method was applied to hybrid zones between color pattern 
      races in a pair of Peruvian Heliconius butterfly species. The species are Müllerian 
      mimics of one another, and both show the same changes in warning color pattern 
      across their respective hybrid zones. The expectations of cline width and gametic 
      correlation were generated using simulations of clines stabilized by strong 
      frequency-dependent selection. In the hybrid zone in Heliconius erato, clines at 
      three major color pattern loci were between 8.5 and 10.2 km wide, and the pairwise 
      gametic correlations peaked at R approximately 0.35. These measures suggest that s 
      approximately 0.23 per locus, and that sigma approximately 2.6 km. In erato, the 
      shapes of the clines agreed with that expected on the basis of dominance. Heliconius 
      melpomene has a nearly coincident hybrid zone. In this species, cline widths at four 
      major color pattern loci varied between 11.7 and 13.4 km. Pairwise gametic 
      correlations peaked near R approximately 1.00 for tightly linked genes, and at R 
      approximately 0.40 for unlinked genes, giving s approximately 0.25 per locus and 
      sigma approximately 3.7 km. In melpomene, cline shapes did not perfectly fit 
      theoretical shapes based on dominance; this deviation might be explained by 
      long-distance migration and/or strong epistasis. Compared with erato, sample sizes 
      in melpomene are lower and the genetics of its color patterns are less well 
      understood. In spite of these problems, selection and gene flow are clearly of the 
      same order of magnitude in the two species. The relatively high per locus selection 
      coefficients agree with "major gene" theories for the evolution of Müllerian 
      mimicry, but the genetic architecture of the color patterns does not. These results 
      show that the genetics and evolution of mimicry are still only sketchily understood.

TI  - Divergent warning patterns contribute to assortative mating between incipient 
      Heliconius species.
PG  - 911-7
LID - 10.1002/ece3.996 [doi]
AB  - Theoretical models suggest that traits under divergent ecological selection, which 
      also contribute to assortative mating, will facilitate speciation with gene flow. 
      Evidence for these so-called "magic traits" now exists across a range of taxa. 
      However, their importance during speciation will depend on the extent to which they 
      contribute to reproductive isolation. Addressing this requires experiments to 
      determine the exact cues involved as well as estimates of assortative mating in the 
      wild. Heliconius butterflies are well known for their diversity of bright warning 
      color patterns, and their amenability to experimental manipulation has provided an 
      excellent opportunity to test their role in reproductive isolation. Here, we reveal 
      that divergent color patterns contribute to mate recognition between the incipient 
      species Heliconius himera and H. erato, a taxon pair for which assortative mating by 
      color pattern has been demonstrated among wild individuals: First, we demonstrate 
      that males are more likely to attempt to mate conspecific females; second, we show 
      that males are more likely to approach pinned females that share their own warning 
      pattern. These data are valuable as these taxa likely represent the early stages of 
      speciation, but unusually also allow comparisons with rates of interbreeding between 
      divergent ecologically relevant phenotypes measured in the wild.

TI  - Haplotype tagging reveals parallel formation of hybrid races in two butterfly 
      species.

AB  - Genetic variation segregates as linked sets of variants or haplotypes. Haplotypes 
      and linkage are central to genetics and underpin virtually all genetic and selection 
      analysis. Yet, genomic data often omit haplotype information due to constraints in 
      sequencing technologies. Here, we present "haplotagging," a simple, low-cost 
      linked-read sequencing technique that allows sequencing of hundreds of individuals 
      while retaining linkage information. We apply haplotagging to construct 
      megabase-size haplotypes for over 600 individual butterflies (Heliconius erato and 
      H. melpomene), which form overlapping hybrid zones across an elevational gradient in 
      Ecuador. Haplotagging identifies loci controlling distinctive high- and lowland wing 
      color patterns. Divergent haplotypes are found at the same major loci in both 
      species, while chromosome rearrangements show no parallelism. Remarkably, in both 
      species, the geographic clines for the major wing-pattern loci are displaced by 18 
      km, leading to the rise of a novel hybrid morph in the center of the hybrid zone. We 
      propose that shared warning signaling (Müllerian mimicry) may couple the cline 
      shifts seen in both species and facilitate the parallel coemergence of a novel 
      hybrid morph in both comimetic species. Our results show the power of efficient 
      haplotyping methods when combined with large-scale sequencing data from natural 
      populations.

AB  - Traditional anatomical analyses captured only a fraction of real phenomic 
      information. Here, we apply deep learning to quantify total phenotypic similarity 
      across 2468 butterfly photographs, covering 38 subspecies from the polymorphic 
      mimicry complex of Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene. Euclidean phenotypic 
      distances, calculated using a deep convolutional triplet network, demonstrate 
      significant convergence between interspecies co-mimics. This quantitatively 
      validates a key prediction of Müllerian mimicry theory, evolutionary biology's 
      oldest mathematical model. Phenotypic neighbor-joining trees are significantly 
      correlated with wing pattern gene phylogenies, demonstrating objective, 
      phylogenetically informative phenome capture. Comparative analyses indicate 
      frequency-dependent mutual convergence with coevolutionary exchange of wing pattern 
      features. Therefore, phenotypic analysis supports reciprocal coevolution, predicted 
      by classical mimicry theory but since disputed, and reveals mutual convergence as an 
      intrinsic generator for the unexpected diversity of Müllerian mimicry. This 
      demonstrates that deep learning can generate phenomic spatial embeddings, which 
      enable quantitative tests of evolutionary hypotheses previously only testable 
      subjectively.

      (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae).
PG  - 907-11
LID - 10.1603/EN09340 [doi]
AB  - Several Heliconius L. butterflies species form nocturnal aggregations in sites with 
      a particular architecture. Roosts are usually formed under relatively dense 
      vegetation mats where dry vines or branches provide a perch for the night. These 
      sites may last for months. To understand the importance of factors related to the 
      expression of Heliconius roosting, data on light, temperature, relative humidity, 
      wind, and use of wing color cues were recorded at H. erato and H. sara roost sites 
      in Costa Rica and Panama in 2008 and 2009. The results show that roost sites offer 
      reduced light conditions at dusk, provide a drier environment compared with its 
      vicinity, and offer protection from wind and rain. Moreover, individuals use wing 
      color recognition under reduced light conditions at dusk to successfully assemble 
      aggregations. These findings provide key information for future experiments to study 
      the use of landmarks, hygrosensitivity, and dim-light eye adaptations in Heliconius 
      navigation to find roost sites.

      Heliconius melpomene clade.
PG  - e1000794
LID - 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000794 [doi]
LID - e1000794
AB  - Wing patterning in Heliconius butterflies is a longstanding example of both 
      Müllerian mimicry and phenotypic radiation under strong natural selection. The loci 
      controlling such patterns are "hotspots" for adaptive evolution with great allelic 
      diversity across different species in the genus. We characterise nucleotide 
      variation, genotype-by-phenotype associations, linkage disequilibrium, and candidate 
      gene expression at two loci and across multiple hybrid zones in Heliconius melpomene 
      and relatives. Alleles at HmB control the presence or absence of the red forewing 
      band, while alleles at HmYb control the yellow hindwing bar. Across HmYb two 
      regions, separated by approximately 100 kb, show significant genotype-by-phenotype 
      associations that are replicated across independent hybrid zones. In contrast, at 
      HmB a single peak of association indicates the likely position of functional sites 
      at three genes, encoding a kinesin, a G-protein coupled receptor, and an mRNA 
      splicing factor. At both HmYb and HmB there is evidence for enhanced linkage 
      disequilibrium (LD) between associated sites separated by up to 14 kb, suggesting 
      that multiple sites are under selection. However, there was no evidence for reduced 
      variation or deviations from neutrality that might indicate a recent selective 
      sweep, consistent with these alleles being relatively old. Of the three genes 
      showing an association with the HmB locus, the kinesin shows differences in wing 
      disc expression between races that are replicated in the co-mimic, Heliconius erato, 
      providing striking evidence for parallel changes in gene expression between 
      Müllerian co-mimics. Wing patterning loci in Heliconius melpomene therefore show a 
      haplotype structure maintained by selection, but no evidence for a recent selective 
      sweep. The complex genetic pattern contrasts with the simple genetic basis of many 
      adaptive traits studied previously, but may provide a better model for most 
      adaptation in natural populations that has arisen over millions rather than tens of 
      years.

AB  - Multilocus clines between Müllerian mimetic races of Heliconius butterflies provide 
      a classic example of the maintenance of hybrid zones and their importance in 
      speciation. Concordant hybrid zones in the mimics Heliconius erato and H. melpomene 
      in northern Peru were carefully documented in the 1980s, and this prior work now 
      permits a historical analysis of the movement or stasis of the zones. Previous work 
      predicted that these zones might be moving toward the Andes due to selective 
      asymmetry. Extensive deforestation and climate change might also be expected to 
      affect the positions and widths of the hybrid zones. We show that the positions and 
      shapes of these hybrid zones have instead remained remarkably stable between 1985 
      and 2012. The stability of this interaction strongly implicates continued selection, 
      rather than neutral mixing following secondary contact. The stability of cline 
      widths and strong linkage disequilibria (gametic correlation coefficients Rmax = 
      0.35-0.56 among unlinked loci) over 25 years suggest that mimetic selection 
      pressures on each color pattern locus have remained approximately constant (s ≈ 
      0.13-0.40 per locus in both species). Exceptionally high levels of precipitation at 
      the edge of the easternmost Andes may act as a population density trough for 
      butterflies, trapping the hybrid zones at the foot of the mountains, and preventing 
      movement. As such, our results falsify one prediction of the Pleistocene Refugium 
      theory: That the ranges of divergent species or subspecies should be centered on 
      regions characterized by maxima of rainfall, with hybrid zones falling in more arid 
      regions between them.

TI  - Sexual Size Dimorphism in the Color Pattern Elements of Two Mimetic Heliconius 
      Butterflies.
PG  - 600-6
LID - 10.1007/s13744-013-0157-x [doi]
AB  - Sexual dichromatism and sexual dimorphism of body size are reasonably well studied 
      in butterflies. Sexual size dimorphism of color pattern elements, however, is much 
      less explored. The object of this study is Heliconius, a genus of butterflies well 
      known for the coevolution between mate color preferences and mimicry. Given the 
      sexual role of wing coloration, we investigated the existence of sexual size 
      dimorphism in the wing color elements of a mimetic pair-Heliconius erato phyllis 
      Fabricius and Heliconius besckei Ménétriés-and analyzed the allometric patterns of 
      these traits. Correlation between size of elements in the dorsal and ventral wing 
      surfaces were also estimated. In both species, three out of four elements were 
      larger in males, but the non-dimorphic element was not the same. With regard to the 
      allometric patterns, our most important finding was that smaller males of one 
      species have proportionally larger yellow bars. This is the first study specifically 
      concerning quantitative sexual dimorphism in the coloration of this well-known genus 
      of butterflies and it opens new prospects to investigate sex-related natural 
      selection and sexual selection of color pattern elements.

TI  - Wing patterning gene redefines the mimetic history of Heliconius butterflies.
PG  - 19666-71
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1110096108 [doi]
AB  - The mimetic butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene have undergone 
      parallel radiations to form a near-identical patchwork of over 20 different 
      wing-pattern races across the Neotropics. Previous molecular phylogenetic work on 
      these radiations has suggested that similar but geographically disjunct color 
      patterns arose multiple times independently in each species. The neutral markers 
      used in these studies, however, can move freely across color pattern boundaries, and 
      therefore might not represent the history of the adaptive traits as accurately as 
      markers linked to color pattern genes. To assess the evolutionary histories across 
      different loci, we compared relationships among races within H. erato and within H. 
      melpomene using a series of unlinked genes, genes linked to color pattern loci, and 
      optix, a gene recently shown to control red color-pattern variation. We found that 
      although unlinked genes partition populations by geographic region, optix had a 
      different history, structuring lineages by red color patterns and supporting a 
      single origin of red-rayed patterns within each species. Genes closely linked 
      (80-250 kb) to optix exhibited only weak associations with color pattern. This study 
      empirically demonstrates the necessity of examining phenotype-determining genomic 
      regions to understand the history of adaptive change in rapidly radiating lineages. 
      With these refined relationships, we resolve a long-standing debate about the 
      origins of the races within each species, supporting the hypothesis that the 
      red-rayed Amazonian pattern evolved recently and expanded, causing disjunctions of 
      more ancestral patterns.

TI  - Gene expression underlying adaptive variation in Heliconius wing patterns: 
      non-modular regulation of overlapping cinnabar and vermilion prepatterns.
PG  - 37-45
AB  - Geographical variation in the mimetic wing patterns of the butterfly Heliconius 
      erato is a textbook example of adaptive polymorphism; however, little is known about 
      how this variation is controlled developmentally. Using microarrays and qPCR, we 
      identified and compared expression of candidate genes potentially involved with a 
      red/yellow forewing band polymorphism in H. erato. We found that transcripts 
      encoding the pigment synthesis enzymes cinnabar and vermilion showed pattern- and 
      polymorphism-related expression patterns, respectively. cinnabar expression was 
      associated with the forewing band regardless of pigment colour, providing the first 
      gene expression pattern known to be correlated with a major Heliconius colour 
      pattern. In contrast, vermilion expression changed spatially over time in red-banded 
      butterflies, but was not expressed at detectable levels in yellow-banded 
      butterflies, suggesting that regulation of this gene may be involved with the 
      red/yellow polymorphism. Furthermore, we found that the yellow pigment, 
      3-hydroxykynurenine, is incorporated into wing scales from the haemolymph rather 
      than being synthesized in situ. We propose that some aspects of Heliconius colour 
      patterns are determined by spatio-temporal overlap of pigment gene transcription 
      prepatterns and speculate that evolutionary changes in vermilion regulation may in 
      part underlie an adaptive colour pattern polymorphism.

TI  - Limited genetic parallels underlie convergent evolution of quantitative pattern 
      variation in mimetic butterflies.
PG  - 1516-1529
LID - 10.1111/jeb.13704 [doi]
AB  - Mimetic systems allow us to address the question of whether the same genes control 
      similar phenotypes in different species. Although widespread parallels have been 
      found for major effect loci, much less is known about genes that control 
      quantitative trait variation. In this study, we identify and compare the loci that 
      control subtle changes in the size and shape of forewing pattern elements in two 
      Heliconius butterfly co-mimics. We use quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis with 
      a multivariate phenotyping approach to map the variation in red pattern elements 
      across the whole forewing surface of Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene. 
      These results are compared with a QTL analysis of univariate trait changes, and show 
      that our resolution for identifying small effect loci is somewhat improved with the 
      multivariate approach, but also that different loci are detected with these 
      different approaches. QTL likely corresponding to the known patterning gene optix 
      were found in both species but otherwise, a remarkably low level of genetic 
      parallelism was found. This lack of similarity indicates that the genetic basis of 
      convergent traits may not be as predictable as assumed from studies that focus 
      solely on Mendelian traits.

TI  - Warning signals are seductive: relative contributions of color and pattern to 
      predator avoidance and mate attraction in Heliconius butterflies.
PG  - 3410-20
LID - 10.1111/evo.12524 [doi]
AB  - Visual signaling in animals can serve many uses, including predator deterrence and 
      mate attraction. In many cases, signals used to advertise unprofitability to 
      predators are also used for intraspecific communication. Although aposematism and 
      mate choice are significant forces driving the evolution of many animal phenotypes, 
      the interplay between relevant visual signals remains little explored. Here, we 
      address this question in the aposematic passion-vine butterfly Heliconius erato by 
      using color- and pattern-manipulated models to test the contributions of different 
      visual features to both mate choice and warning coloration. We found that the 
      relative effectiveness of a model at escaping predation was correlated with its 
      effectiveness at inducing mating behavior, and in both cases wing color was more 
      predictive of presumptive fitness benefits than wing pattern. Overall, however, a 
      combination of the natural (local) color and pattern was most successful for both 
      predator deterrence and mate attraction. By exploring the relative contributions of 
      color versus pattern composition in predation and mate preference studies, we have 
      shown how both natural and sexual selection may work in parallel to drive the 
      evolution of specific animal color patterns.

AB  - Newly hatched caterpillars of the butterfly Heliconius erato phyllis routinely 
      cannibalize eggs. In a manifestation of kin recognition they cannibalize sibling 
      eggs less frequently than unrelated eggs. Previous work has estimated the 
      heritability of kin recognition in H. erato phyllis to lie between 14 and 48%. It 
      has furthermore been shown that the inheritance of kin recognition is compatible 
      with a quantitative model with a threshold. Here we present the results of a 
      preliminary study, in which we tested for associations between behavioral kin 
      recognition phenotypes and AFLP and SSR markers. We implemented two experimental 
      approaches: (1) a cannibalism test using sibling eggs only, which allowed for only 
      two behavioral outcomes (cannibal and non-cannibal), and (2) a cannibalism test 
      using two sibling eggs and one unrelated egg, which allowed four outcomes [cannibal 
      who does not recognize siblings, cannibal who recognizes siblings, "super-cannibal" 
      (cannibal of both eggs), and "super non-cannibal" (does not cannibalize eggs at 
      all)]. Single-marker analyses were performed using χ2 tests and logistic regression 
      with null markers as covariates. Results of the χ2 tests identified 72 associations 
      for experimental design 1 and 73 associations for design 2. Logistic regression 
      analysis of the markers found to be significant in the χ2 test resulted in 20 
      associations for design 1 and 11 associations for design 2. Experiment 2 identified 
      markers that were more frequently present or absent in cannibals who recognize 
      siblings and super non-cannibals; i.e. in both phenotypes capable of kin 
      recognition.

AB  - Heliconius butterflies are an excellent system for understanding the genetic basis 
      of phenotypic change. Here we document surprising diversity in the genetic control 
      of a common phenotype. Two disjunct H. erato populations have each recruited the Cr 
      and/or Sd loci that control similar yellow hindwing patterns, but the alleles 
      involved partially complement one another indicating either multiple origins for the 
      patterning alleles or developmental drift in genetic control of similar patterns. We 
      show that in these H. erato populations cr and sd are epistatically interacting and 
      that the parental origin of alleles can explain phenotypes of backcross individuals. 
      In contrast, mimetic H. melpomene populations with identical phenotypes (H. m. 
      rosina and H. m. amaryllis) do not show genetic complementation (F(1)s and F(2)s are 
      phenotypically identical to parentals). Finally, we report hybrid female inviability 
      in H. m. melpomene × H. m. rosina crosses (previously only female infertility had 
      been reported) and presence of standing genetic variation for alternative color 
      alleles at the Yb locus in true breeding H. melpomene melpomene populations 
      (expressed when in a different genomic background) that could be an important source 
      of variation for the evolution of novel phenotypes or a result of developmental 
      drift. Although recent work has emphasized the simple genetic control of wing 
      pattern in Heliconius, we show there is underlying complexity in the allelic 
      variation and epistatic interactions between major patterning loci.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heliconius butterfly wing pattern diversity offers a unique opportunity 
      to investigate how natural genetic variation can drive the evolution of complex 
      adaptive phenotypes. Positional cloning and candidate gene studies have identified a 
      handful of regulatory and pigmentation genes implicated in Heliconius wing pattern 
      variation, but little is known about the greater developmental networks within which 
      these genes interact to pattern a wing. Here we took a large-scale transcriptomic 
      approach to identify the network of genes involved in Heliconius wing pattern 
      development and variation. This included applying over 140 transcriptome microarrays 
      to assay gene expression in dissected wing pattern elements across a range of 
      developmental stages and wing pattern morphs of Heliconius erato. RESULTS: We 
      identified a number of putative early prepattern genes with color-pattern related 
      expression domains. We also identified 51 genes differentially expressed in 
      association with natural color pattern variation. Of these, the previously 
      identified color pattern "switch gene" optix was recovered as the first transcript 
      to show color-specific differential expression. Most differentially expressed genes 
      were transcribed late in pupal development and have roles in cuticle formation or 
      pigment synthesis. These include previously undescribed transporter genes associated 
      with ommochrome pigmentation. Furthermore, we observed upregulation of 
      melanin-repressing genes such as ebony and Dat1 in non-melanic patterns. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies many new genes implicated in butterfly wing 
      pattern development and provides a glimpse into the number and types of genes 
      affected by variation in genes that drive color pattern evolution.

TI  - Wing patterning genes and coevolution of Müllerian mimicry in Heliconius 
      butterflies: Support from phylogeography, cophylogeny, and divergence times.
PG  - 3082-96
LID - 10.1111/evo.12812 [doi]
AB  - Examples of long-term coevolution are rare among free-living organisms. Müllerian 
      mimicry in Heliconius butterflies had been suggested as a key example of coevolution 
      by early genetic studies. However, research over the last two decades has been 
      dominated by the idea that the best-studied comimics, H. erato and H. melpomene, did 
      not coevolve at all. Recently sequenced genes associated with wing color pattern 
      phenotype offer a new opportunity to resolve this controversy. Here, we test the 
      hypothesis of coevolution between H. erato and H. melpomene using Bayesian 
      multilocus analysis of five color pattern genes and five neutral genetic markers. We 
      first explore the extent of phylogenetic agreement versus conflict between the 
      different genes. Coevolution is then tested against three aspects of the mimicry 
      diversifications: phylogenetic branching patterns, divergence times, and, for the 
      first time, phylogeographic histories. We show that all three lines of evidence are 
      compatible with strict coevolution of the diverse mimicry wing patterns, contrary to 
      some recent suggestions. Instead, these findings tally with a coevolutionary 
      diversification driven primarily by the ecological force of Müllerian mimicry.

TI  - Subtle variation in size and shape of the whole forewing and the red band among 
      co-mimics revealed by geometric morphometric analysis in Heliconius butterflies.
PG  - 3280-3295
LID - 10.1002/ece3.3916 [doi]
AB  - Heliconius are unpalatable butterflies that exhibit remarkable intra- and 
      interspecific variation in wing color pattern, specifically warning coloration. 
      Species that have converged on the same pattern are often clustered in Müllerian 
      mimicry rings. Overall, wing color patterns are nearly identical among co-mimics. 
      However, fine-scale differences exist, indicating that factors in addition to 
      natural selection may underlie wing phenotype. Here, we investigate differences in 
      shape and size of the forewing and the red band in the Heliconius postman mimicry 
      ring (H. erato phyllis and the co-mimics H. besckei, H. melpomene burchelli, and 
      H. melpomene nanna) using a landmark-based approach. If phenotypic evolution is 
      driven entirely by predation pressure, we expect nonsignificant differences among 
      co-mimics in terms of wing shape. Also, a reinforcement of wing pattern (i.e., 
      greater similarity) could occur when co-mimics are in sympatry. We also examined 
      variation in the red forewing band because this trait is critical for both mimicry 
      and sexual communication. Morphometric results revealed significant but small 
      differences among species, particularly in the shape of the forewing of co-mimics. 
      Although we did not observe greater similarity when co-mimics were in sympatry, 
      nearly identical patterns provided evidence of convergence for mimicry. In contrast, 
      mimetic pairs could be distinguished based on the shape (but not the size) of the 
      red band, suggesting an "advergence" process. In addition, sexual dimorphism in the 
      red band shape (but not size) was found for all lineages. Thus, we infer that 
      natural selection due to predation by birds might not be the only mechanism 
      responsible for variation in color patterns, and sexual selection could be an 
      important driver of wing phenotypic evolution in this mimicry ring.

TI  - Convergent evolution in the genetic basis of Müllerian mimicry in heliconius 
      butterflies.
PG  - 1567-77
LID - 10.1534/genetics.107.082982 [doi]
AB  - The neotropical butterflies Heliconius melpomene and H. erato are Müllerian mimics 
      that display the same warningly colored wing patterns in local populations, yet 
      pattern diversity between geographic regions. Linkage mapping has previously shown 
      convergent red wing phenotypes in these species are controlled by loci on homologous 
      chromosomes. Here, AFLP bulk segregant analysis using H. melpomene crosses 
      identified genetic markers tightly linked to two red wing-patterning loci. These 
      markers were used to screen a H. melpomene BAC library and a tile path was assembled 
      spanning one locus completely and part of the second. Concurrently, a similar 
      strategy was used to identify a BAC clone tightly linked to the locus controlling 
      the mimetic red wing phenotypes in H. erato. A methionine rich storage protein 
      (MRSP) gene was identified within this BAC clone, and comparative genetic mapping 
      shows red wing color loci are in homologous regions of the genome of H. erato and H. 
      melpomene. Subtle differences in these convergent phenotypes imply they evolved 
      independently using somewhat different developmental routes, but are nonetheless 
      regulated by the same switch locus. Genetic mapping of MRSP in a third related 
      species, the "tiger" patterned H. numata, has no association with wing patterning 
      and shows no evidence for genomic translocation of wing-patterning loci.

AB  - Vom Rath's organ, located at the distal end of the third segment of the labial palp, 
      is one of the recognized synapomorphies of Lepidoptera (Insecta). Information about 
      the structural and histological morphology of this organ is sparse. The structure of 
      vom Rath's organ in four species of Nymphalidae, three frugivorous: Fountainea 
      ryphea (Charaxinae: Anaeini), Morpho helenor achillaena (Satyrinae: Morphini) and 
      Hamadryas epinome (Biblidinae: Ageroniini), and the nectarivorous species Aeria 
      olena (Danainae: Ithomiini) is described by means of scanning electron microscopy 
      and histology. The species showed significant differences in the cavity shape, setal 
      morphology and arrangement, opening shape and location, associated with the 
      organization of cell groups, type of axon, and degree of development. These 
      differences do not seem to be related to feeding habit. No cell groups were found in 
      Actinote thalia (Heliconiinae: Acraeini) and Heliconius erato phyllis (Heliconiinae: 
      Heliconiini), and for the first time the absence of vom Rath's organ is documented 
      in the clade Ditrysia. A terminology is proposed to improve understanding of the 
      organ morphology, with an extensive analysis of the previous descriptions.

TI  - Müllerian mimicry of a quantitative trait despite contrasting levels of genomic 
      divergence and selection.
PG  - 2016-2030
LID - 10.1111/mec.15460 [doi]
AB  - Hybrid zones, where distinct populations meet and interbreed, give insight into how 
      differences between populations are maintained despite gene flow. Studying clines in 
      genetic loci and adaptive traits across hybrid zones is a powerful method for 
      understanding how selection drives differentiation within a single species, but can 
      also be used to compare parallel divergence in different species responding to a 
      common selective pressure. Here, we study parallel divergence of wing colouration in 
      the butterflies Heliconius erato and H. melpomene, which are distantly related 
      Müllerian mimics which show parallel geographic variation in both discrete variation 
      in pigmentation, and quantitative variation in structural colour. Using geographic 
      cline analysis, we show that clines in these traits are positioned in roughly the 
      same geographic region for both species, which is consistent with direct selection 
      for mimicry. However, the width of the clines varies markedly between species. This 
      difference is explained in part by variation in the strength of selection acting on 
      colour traits within each species, but may also be influenced by differences in the 
      dispersal rate and total strength of selection against hybrids between the species. 
      Genotyping-by-sequencing also revealed weaker population structure in H. melpomene, 
      suggesting the hybrid zones may have evolved differently in each species, which may 
      also contribute to the patterns of phenotypic divergence in this system. Overall, we 
      conclude that multiple factors are needed to explain patterns of clinal variation 
      within and between these species, although mimicry has probably played a central 
      role.

AB  - Identifying the genomic changes that control morphological variation and 
      understanding how they generate diversity is a major goal of evolutionary biology. 
      In Heliconius butterflies, a small number of genes control the development of 
      diverse wing color patterns. Here, we used full genome sequencing of individuals 
      across the Heliconius erato radiation and closely related species to characterize 
      genomic variation associated with wing pattern diversity. We show that variation 
      around color pattern genes is highly modular, with narrow genomic intervals 
      associated with specific differences in color and pattern. This modular architecture 
      explains the diversity of color patterns and provides a flexible mechanism for rapid 
      morphological diversification.

TI  - Interspecific sexual attraction because of convergence in warning colouration: is

PG  - 749-60

AB  - When species converge in their colour patterns because of mimicry, and those 
      patterns are also used in mate recognition, there is a probability of conflicting 
      selection pressures. Closely related species that mimic one another are particularly 
      likely to face such confusion because of similarities in their courtship behaviour 
      and ecology. We conducted experiments in greenhouse conditions to study 
      interspecific attraction between two mimetic butterfly species, Heliconius erato and 
      Heliconius melpomene. Both species spent considerable time approaching and courting 
      females of the co-mimic species. Experiments using wing models demonstrated the 
      importance of colour pattern in this interspecific attraction. Although males of H. 
      melpomene were attracted to their co-mimics as much as to their own females, H. 
      erato males were more efficient at distinguishing conspecifics, possibly using wing 
      odours. Although preliminary, these results suggest that the use of additional cues 
      may have evolved in H. erato to reduce the cost of convergence in visual signals 
      with H. melpomene. Overall, our results showed that there might be a cost of mimetic 
      convergence because of a reduction in the efficiency of species recognition. Such 
      cost may contribute to explain the apparently stable diversity in Müllerian mimetic 
      patterns in many tropical butterfly assemblages.

TI  - Learning in two butterfly species when using flowers of the tropical milkweed 
      Asclepias curassavica: No benefits for pollination.
PG  - 1168-1178
LID - 10.3732/ajb.1700040 [doi]
AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The ability of insect visitors to learn to manipulate complex 
      flowers has important consequences for foraging efficiency and plant fitness. We 
      investigated learning by two butterfly species, Danaus erippus and Heliconius erato, 
      as they foraged on the complex flowers of Asclepias curassavica, as well as the 
      consequences for pollination. METHODS: To examine learning with respect to flower 
      manipulation, butterflies were individually tested during four consecutive days 
      under insectary conditions. At the end of each test, we recorded the number of 
      pollinaria attached to the body of each butterfly and scored visited flowers for 
      numbers of removed and inserted pollinia. We also conducted a field study to survey 
      D. erippus and H. erato visiting flowers of A. curassavica, as well as to record 
      numbers of pollinaria attached to the butterflies' bodies, and surveyed A. 
      curassavica plants in the field to inspect flowers for pollinium removal and 
      insertion. KEY RESULTS: Learning improves the ability of both butterfly species to 
      avoid the nonrewarding flower parts and to locate nectar more efficiently. There 
      were no experience effects, for either species, on the numbers of removed and 
      inserted pollinia. Heliconius erato removed and inserted more pollinia than D. 
      erippus. For both butterfly species, pollinium removal was higher than pollinium 
      insertion. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that Danaus and Heliconius 
      butterflies can learn to manipulate complex flowers, but this learning ability does 
      not confer benefits to pollination in A. curassavica.

TI  - Evolution of the wave: aerodynamic and aposematic functions of butterfly wing 
      motion.
PG  - 913-7
AB  - Many unpalatable butterfly species use coloration to signal their distastefulness to 
      birds, but motion cues may also be crucial to ward off predatory attacks. In 
      previous research, captive passion-vine butterflies Heliconius mimetic in colour 
      pattern were also mimetic in motion. Here, I investigate whether wing motion changes 
      with the flight demands of different behaviours. If birds select for wing motion as 
      a warning signal, aposematic butterflies should maintain wing motion independently 
      of behavioural context. Members of one mimicry group (Heliconius cydno and 
      Heliconius sapho) beat their wings more slowly and their wing strokes were more 
      asymmetric than their sister-species (Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius erato, 
      respectively), which were members of another mimicry group having a quick and steady 
      wing motion. Within mimicry groups, wing beat frequency declined as its role in 
      generating lift also declined in different behavioural contexts. In contrast, 
      asymmetry of the stroke was not associated with wing beat frequency or behavioural 
      context-strong indication that birds process and store the Fourier motion energy of 
      butterfly wings. Although direct evidence that birds respond to subtle differences 
      in butterfly wing motion is lacking, birds appear to generalize a motion pattern as 
      much as they encounter members of a mimicry group in different behavioural contexts.

TI  - Color discrimination in the red range with only one long-wavelength sensitive opsin.
PG  - 1944-55
AB  - The basic precondition for color vision is the presence of at least two receptor 
      types with different spectral sensitivities. The sensitivity of a receptor is mostly 
      defined by the opsin-based visual pigment expressed in it. We show here, through 
      behavioral experiments, that the nymphalid butterfly Heliconius erato, although it 
      expresses short and medium wavelength opsins and only one long wavelength opsin, 
      discriminates colors in the long-wavelength range (590 nm, 620 nm and 640 nm), 
      whereas another nymphalid, Vanessa atalanta, despite having color vision, is unable 
      to do so. In the eyes of H. erato we identified filtering pigments very close to the 
      rhabdom which differ between ommatidia and produce the yellow and red ommatidial 
      reflection seen under orthodromic illumination. The eyes of V. atalanta lack the 
      filtering pigments, and reflect a homogeneous orange. We hypothesize that the 
      filtering pigments found in the eyes of H. erato may shift the spectral sensitivity 
      peak of the long wavelength receptors in some ommatidia towards longer wavelengths. 
      The comparison of the signals between the two new receptor types makes color 
      discrimination in the red range possible. To our knowledge, this is the first 
      behavioral proof of color vision based on receptors expressing the same opsin.

TI  - Microclimate buffering and thermal tolerance across elevations in a tropical 
      butterfly.

AB  - Microclimatic variability in tropical forests plays a key role in shaping species 
      distributions and their ability to cope with environmental change, especially for 
      ectotherms. Nonetheless, currently available climatic datasets lack data from the 
      forest interior and, furthermore, our knowledge of thermal tolerance among tropical 
      ectotherms is limited. We therefore studied natural variation in the microclimate 
      experienced by tropical butterflies in the genus Heliconius across their Andean 
      range in a single year. We found that the forest strongly buffers temperature and 
      humidity in the understorey, especially in the lowlands, where temperatures are more 
      extreme. There were systematic differences between our yearly records and 
      macroclimate databases (WorldClim2), with lower interpolated minimum temperatures 
      and maximum temperatures higher than expected. We then assessed thermal tolerance of 
      10 Heliconius butterfly species in the wild and found that populations at high 
      elevations had significantly lower heat tolerance than those at lower elevations. 
      However, when we reared populations of the widespread H. erato from high and low 
      elevations in a common-garden environment, the difference in heat tolerance across 
      elevations was reduced, indicating plasticity in this trait. Microclimate buffering 
      is not currently captured in publicly available datasets, but could be crucial for 
      enabling upland shifting of species sensitive to heat such as highland Heliconius 
      Plasticity in thermal tolerance may alleviate the effects of global warming on some 
      widespread ectotherm species, but more research is needed to understand the 
      long-term consequences of plasticity on populations and species.

AB  - Frequency-dependent selection on warning color can maintain narrow hybrid zones 
      between unpalatable prey taxa. To measure such selection, we transferred marked 
      Heliconius erato (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) in both directions across a 10-km-wide 
      hybrid zone between Peruvian races differing in color pattern. These experimental H. 
      erato were released at four sites, along with control H. erato of the phenotype 
      native to each site. Survival of experimental butterflies was significantly lower 
      than that of controls at two sites and overall. Most selection, measured as 
      differences in survival, occurred soon after release. Selection against foreign 
      morphs was 52% (confidence limits: 25-71 %) and was probably due to bird attacks on 
      unusual warning-color morphs (more than 10% of the recaptures had beak marks). Since 
      only three major loci determine the color-pattern differences, this suggests an 
      average selection coefficient of 0.17 per locus, sufficient to maintain the narrow 
      clines in H. erato.

TI  - Genomic tools and cDNA derived markers for butterflies.
PG  - 2883-97
AB  - The Lepidoptera have long been used as examples in the study of evolution, but some 
      questions remain difficult to resolve due to a lack of molecular genetic data. 
      However, as technology improves, genomic tools are becoming increasingly available 
      to tackle unanswered evolutionary questions. Here we have used expressed sequence 
      tags (ESTs) to develop genetic markers for two Müllerian mimic species, Heliconius 
      melpomene and Heliconius erato. In total 1363 ESTs were generated, representing 330 
      gene objects in H. melpomene and 431 in H. erato. User-friendly bioinformatic tools 
      were used to construct a nonredundant database of these putative genes (available at 
      http://www.heliconius.org), and annotate them with blast similarity searches, 
      InterPro matches and Gene Ontology terms. This database will be continually updated 
      with EST sequences for the Papilionideae as they become publicly available, 
      providing a tool for gene finding in the butterflies. Alignments of the Heliconius 
      sequences with putative homologues derived from Bombyx mori or other public data 
      sets were used to identify conserved PCR priming sites, and develop 55 markers that 
      can be amplified from genomic DNA in both H. erato and H. melpomene. These markers 
      will be used for comparative linkage mapping in Heliconius and will have 
      applications in other phylogenetic and genomic studies in the Lepidoptera.

TI  - Rapid movement of a Heliconius hybrid zone: evidence for phase III of Wright's 
      shifting balance theory?
PG  - 1992-8
AB  - It has been proposed that a moving hybrid zone can be a mechanism for the spread of 
      adaptive traits in phase III of Wright's shifting balance model of evolution. Here I 
      present an example of a moving hybrid zone in warningly colored Heliconius 
      butterflies, a system which is considered to be a possible case of shifting balance 
      evolution. Having moved approximately 47 km in 17 years, the hybrid zone shift has 
      led to the H. erato hydara color pattern rapidly displacing the adjacent H. erato 
      petiverana pattern. The movement is potentially due to dominance drive augmenting a 
      slight selective advantage of H. erato hydara over H. erato petiverana, which is 
      largely consistent with theoretical conditions favoring the success of phase III.

TI  - A conserved supergene locus controls colour pattern diversity in Heliconius 
      butterflies.
PG  - e303
LID - e303
AB  - We studied whether similar developmental genetic mechanisms are involved in both 
      convergent and divergent evolution. Mimetic insects are known for their diversity of 
      patterns as well as their remarkable evolutionary convergence, and they have played 
      an important role in controversies over the respective roles of selection and 
      constraints in adaptive evolution. Here we contrast three butterfly species, all 
      classic examples of Müllerian mimicry. We used a genetic linkage map to show that a 
      locus, Yb, which controls the presence of a yellow band in geographic races of 
      Heliconius melpomene, maps precisely to the same location as the locus Cr, which has 
      very similar phenotypic effects in its co-mimic H. erato. Furthermore, the same 
      genomic location acts as a "supergene", determining multiple sympatric morphs in a 
      third species, H. numata. H. numata is a species with a very different phenotypic 
      appearance, whose many forms mimic different unrelated ithomiine butterflies in the 
      genus Melinaea. Other unlinked colour pattern loci map to a homologous linkage group 
      in the co-mimics H. melpomene and H. erato, but they are not involved in mimetic 
      polymorphism in H. numata. Hence, a single region from the multilocus colour pattern 
      architecture of H. melpomene and H. erato appears to have gained control of the 
      entire wing-pattern variability in H. numata, presumably as a result of selection 
      for mimetic "supergene" polymorphism without intermediates. Although we cannot at 
      this stage confirm the homology of the loci segregating in the three species, our 
      results imply that a conserved yet relatively unconstrained mechanism underlying 
      pattern switching can affect mimicry in radically different ways. We also show that 
      adaptive evolution, both convergent and diversifying, can occur by the repeated 
      involvement of the same genomic regions.

TI  - Phylogenetic discordance at the species boundary: comparative gene genealogies among 
      rapidly radiating Heliconius butterflies.
PG  - 2176-90
AB  - Recent adaptive radiations provide excellent model systems for understanding 
      speciation, but rapid diversification can cause problems for phylogenetic inference. 
      Here we use gene genealogies to investigate the phylogeny of recent speciation in 
      the heliconiine butterflies. We sequenced three gene regions, intron 3 ( 
      approximately 550 bp) of sex-linked triose-phosphate isomerase (Tpi), intron 3 ( 
      approximately 450 bp) of autosomal mannose-phosphate isomerase (Mpi), and 1,603 bp 
      of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunits I and II (COI and COII), for 37 
      individuals from 25 species of Heliconius and related genera. The nuclear intron 
      sequences evolved at rates similar to those of mitochondrial coding sequences, but 
      the phylogenetic utility of introns was restricted to closely related geographic 
      populations and species due to high levels of indel variation. For two sister 
      species pairs, Heliconius erato-Heliconius himera and Heliconius 
      melpomene-Heliconius cydno, there was highly significant discordance between the 
      three genes. At mtDNA and Tpi, the hypotheses of reciprocal monophyly and paraphyly 
      of at least one species with respect to its sister could not be distinguished. In 
      contrast alleles sampled from the third locus, Mpi, showed polyphyletic 
      relationships between both species pairs. In all cases, recent coalescence of mtDNA 
      lineages within species suggests that polyphyly of nuclear genes is not unexpected. 
      In addition, very similar alleles were shared between melpomene and cydno, implying 
      recent gene flow. Our finding of discordant genealogies between genes is consistent 
      with models of adaptive speciation with ongoing gene flow and highlights the need 
      for multiple locus comparisons to resolve phylogeny among closely related species.

TI  - Lep-MAP3: robust linkage mapping even for low-coverage whole genome sequencing data.
PG  - 3726-3732
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btx494 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Accurate and dense linkage maps are useful in family-based linkage and 
      association studies, quantitative trait locus mapping, analysis of genome synteny 
      and other genomic data analyses. Moreover, linkage mapping is one of the best ways 
      to detect errors in de novo genome assemblies, as well as to orient and place 
      assembly contigs within chromosomes. A small mapping cross of tens of individuals 
      will detect many errors where distant parts of the genome are erroneously joined 
      together. With more individuals and markers, even more local errors can be detected 
      and more contigs can be oriented. However, the tools that are currently available 
      for constructing linkage maps are not well suited for large, possible low-coverage, 
      whole genome sequencing datasets. RESULTS: Here we present a linkage mapping 
      software Lep-MAP3, capable of mapping high-throughput whole genome sequencing 
      datasets. Such data allows cost-efficient genotyping of millions of single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for thousands of individual samples, enabling, among 
      other analyses, comprehensive validation and refinement of de novo genome 
      assemblies. The algorithms of Lep-MAP3 can analyse low-coverage datasets and reduce 
      data filtering and curation on any data. This yields more markers in the final maps 
      with less manual work even on problematic datasets. We demonstrate that Lep-MAP3 
      obtains very good performance already on 5x sequencing coverage and outperforms the 
      fastest available software on simulated data on accuracy and often on speed. We also 
      construct de novo linkage maps on 7-12x whole-genome data on the Red postman 
      butterfly (Heliconius erato) with almost 3 million markers. AVAILABILITY AND 
      IMPLEMENTATION: Lep-MAP3 is available with the source code under GNU general public

TI  - The benefit of being a social butterfly: communal roosting deters predation.
PG  - 2769-76
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2012.0203 [doi]
AB  - Aposematic passion-vine butterflies from the genus Heliconius form communal roosts 
      on a nightly basis. This behaviour has been hypothesized to be beneficial in terms 
      of information sharing and/or anti-predator defence. To better understand the 
      adaptive value of communal roosting, we tested these two hypotheses in field 
      studies. The information-sharing hypothesis was addressed by examining following 
      behaviour of butterflies departing from natural roosts. We found no evidence of 
      roost mates following one another to resources, thus providing no support for this 
      hypothesis. The anti-predator defence hypothesis was tested using 
      avian-indiscriminable Heliconius erato models placed singly and in aggregations at 
      field sites. A significantly higher number of predation attempts were observed on 
      solitary models versus aggregations of models. This relationship between aggregation 
      size and attack rate suggests that communally roosting butterflies enjoy the 
      benefits of both overall decreased attack frequency as well as a prey dilution 
      effect. Communal roosts probably deter predators through collective aposematism in 
      which aggregations of conspicuous, unpalatable prey communicate a more effective 
      repel signal to predators. On the basis of our results, we propose that predation by 
      birds is a key selective pressure maintaining Heliconius communal roosting 
      behaviour.

TI  - Multiple recent co-options of Optix associated with novel traits in adaptive 
      butterfly wing radiations.
PG  - 7
LID - 10.1186/2041-9139-5-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the ecological factors that drive phenotypic radiations are often 
      well understood, less is known about the generative mechanisms that cause the 
      emergence and subsequent diversification of novel features. Heliconius butterflies 
      display an extraordinary diversity of wing patterns due in part to mimicry and 
      sexual selection. Identifying the genetic drivers of this crucible of evolution is 
      now within reach, as it was recently shown that cis-regulatory variation of the 
      optix transcription factor explains red pattern differences in the adaptive 
      radiations of the Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius erato species groups. RESULTS: 
      Here, we compare the developmental expression of the Optix protein across a large 
      phylogenetic sample of butterflies and infer that its color patterning role 
      originated at the base of the neotropical passion-vine butterfly clade (Lepidoptera, 
      Nymphalidae, Tribe: Heliconiini), shortly predating multiple Optix-driven wing 
      pattern radiations in the speciose Heliconius and Eueides genera. We also 
      characterize novel Optix and Doublesex expression in the male-specific pheromone 
      wing scales of the basal heliconiines Dryas and Agraulis, thus illustrating that 
      within the Heliconinii lineage, Optix has been evolutionarily redeployed in multiple 
      contexts in association with diverse wing features. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal 
      that the repeated co-option of Optix into various aspects of wing scale 
      specification was associated with multiple evolutionary novelties over a relatively 
      short evolutionary time scale. In particular, the recruitment of Optix expression in 
      colored scale cell precursors was a necessary condition to the explosive 
      diversification of passion-vine butterfly wing patterns. The novel deployment of a 
      gene followed by spatial modulation of its expression in a given cell type could be 
      a common mode of developmental innovation for triggering phenotypic radiations.

TI  - Multiple sources of reproductive isolation in a bimodal butterfly hybrid zone.
PG  - 1312-20
LID - 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02001.x [doi]
AB  - An important evolutionary question concerns whether one or many barriers are 
      involved in the early stages of speciation. We examine pre- and post-zygotic 
      reproductive barriers between two species of butterflies (Heliconius erato 
      chestertonii and H. e. venus) separated by a bimodal hybrid zone in the Cauca 
      Valley, Colombia. We show that there is both strong pre- and post-mating 
      reproductive isolation, together leading to a 98% reduction in gene flow between the 
      species. Pre-mating isolation plays a primary role, contributing strongly to this 
      isolation (87%), similar to previous examples in Heliconius. Post-mating isolation 
      was also strong, with absence of Haldane's rule, but an asymmetric reduction in 
      fertility (< 11%) in inter-specific crosses depending on maternal genotype. In 
      summary, this is one of the first examples of post-zygotic reproductive isolation 
      playing a significant role in early stages of parapatric speciation in Heliconius 
      and demonstrates the importance of multiple barriers to gene flow in the speciation 
      process.

TI  - What initiates speciation in passion-vine butterflies?
PG  - 8628-33
AB  - Studies of the continuum between geographic races and species provide the clearest 
      insights into the causes of speciation. Here we report on mate choice and hybrid 
      viability experiments in a pair of warningly colored butterflies, Heliconius erato 
      and Heliconius himera, that maintain their genetic integrity in the face of 
      hybridization. Hybrid sterility and inviability have been unimportant in the early 
      stages of speciation of these two Heliconius. We find no evidence of reduced 
      fecundity, egg hatch, or larval survival nor increases in developmental time in 
      three generations of hybrid crosses. Instead, speciation in this pair appears to 
      have been catalyzed by the association of strong mating preferences with divergence 
      in warning coloration and ecology. In mate choice experiments, matings between the 
      two species are a tenth as likely as matings within species. F1 hybrids of both 
      sexes mate frequently with both pure forms. However, male F1 progeny from crosses 
      between H. himera mothers and H. erato fathers have somewhat reduced mating success. 
      The strong barrier to gene flow provided by divergence in mate preference is 
      probably enhanced by frequency-dependent predation against hybrids similar to the 
      type known to occur across interracial hybrid zones of H. erato. In addition, the 
      transition between this pair falls at the boundary between wet and dry forest, and 
      rare hybrids may also be selected against because they are poorly adapted to either 
      biotope. These results add to a growing body of evidence that challenge the 
      importance of genomic incompatibilities in the earliest stages of speciation.

TI  - PARALLEL RACE FORMATION AND THE EVOLUTION OF MIMICRY IN HELICONIUS BUTTERFLIES: A 
      PHYLOGENETIC HYPOTHESIS FROM MITOCHONDRIAL DNA SEQUENCES.
PG  - 195-221
LID - 10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb04486.x [doi]
AB  - Mimicry has been a fundamental focus of research since the birth of evolutionary 
      biology yet rarely has been studied from a phylogenetic perspective beyond the 
      simple recognition that mimics are not similar due to common descent. The difficulty 
      of finding characters to discern relationships among closely related and convergent 
      taxa has challenged systematists for more than a century. The phenotypic diversity 
      of wing pattens among mimetic Heliconius adds an additional twist to the problem, 
      because single species contain more than a dozen radically different-looking 
      geographical races even though the mimetic advantage is theoretically highest when 
      all individuals within and between species appear the same. Mitochondrial DNA 
      (mtDNA) offers an independent way to address these issues. In this study, Cytochrome 
      Oxidase I and II sequences from multiple, parallel races of Heliconius erato and 
      Heliconius melpomene are examined, to estimate intraspecific phylogeny and gauge 
      sequence divergence and ages of clades among races within each species. Although 
      phenotypes of sympatric races exhibit remarkable concordance between the two 
      species, the mitochondrial cladograms show that the species have not shared a common 
      evolutionary history. H. erato exhibits a basal split between trans- and cis-Andean 
      groups of races, whereas H. melpomene originates in the Guiana Shield. Diverse races 
      in either species appear to have evolved within the last 200,000 yr, and convergent 
      phenotypes have evolved independently within as well as between species. These 
      results contradict prior theories of the evolution of mimicry based on analysis of 
      wing-pattern genetics.

TI  - Natural hybridization in heliconiine butterflies: the species boundary as a 
      continuum.
PG  - 28
AB  - BACKGROUND: To understand speciation and the maintenance of taxa as separate 
      entities, we need information about natural hybridization and gene flow among 
      species. RESULTS: Interspecific hybrids occur regularly in Heliconius and Eueides 
      (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) in the wild: 26-29% of the species of Heliconiina are 
      involved, depending on species concept employed. Hybridization is, however, rare on 
      a per-individual basis. For one well-studied case of species hybridizing in 
      parapatric contact (Heliconius erato and H. himera), phenotypically detectable 
      hybrids form around 10% of the population, but for species in sympatry hybrids 
      usually form less than 0.05% of individuals. There is a roughly exponential decline 
      with genetic distance in the numbers of natural hybrids in collections, both between 
      and within species, suggesting a simple "exponential failure law" of compatibility 
      as found in some prokaryotes. CONCLUSION: Hybridization between species of 
      Heliconius appears to be a natural phenomenon; there is no evidence that it has been 
      enhanced by recent human habitat disturbance. In some well-studied cases, 
      backcrossing occurs in the field and fertile backcrosses have been verified in 
      insectaries, which indicates that introgression is likely, and recent molecular work 
      shows that alleles at some but not all loci are exchanged between pairs of 
      sympatric, hybridizing species. Molecular clock dating suggests that gene exchange 
      may continue for more than 3 million years after speciation. In addition, one 
      species, H. heurippa, appears to have formed as a result of hybrid speciation. 
      Introgression may often contribute to adaptive evolution as well as sometimes to 
      speciation itself, via hybrid speciation. Geographic races and species that coexist 
      in sympatry therefore form part of a continuum in terms of hybridization rates or 
      probability of gene flow. This finding concurs with the view that processes leading 
      to speciation are continuous, rather than sudden, and that they are the same as 
      those operating within species, rather than requiring special punctuated effects or 
      complete allopatry. Although not qualitatively distinct from geographic races, nor 
      "real" in terms of phylogenetic species concepts or the biological species concept, 
      hybridizing species of Heliconius are stably distinct in sympatry, and remain useful 
      groups for predicting morphological, ecological, behavioural and genetic 
      characteristics.

TI  - Multilocus analyses of admixture and introgression among hybridizing Heliconius 
      butterflies.
PG  - 1254-68
AB  - Introgressive hybridization is an important evolutionary process and new analytical 
      methods provide substantial power to detect and quantify it. In this study we use 
      variation in the frequency of 657 AFLP fragments and DNA sequence variation from 15 
      genes to measure the extent of admixture and the direction of interspecific gene 
      flow among three Heliconius butterfly species that diverged recently as a result of 
      natural selection for Miillerian mimicry, and which continue to hybridize. Bayesian 
      clustering based on AFLP genotypes correctly delineated the three species and 
      identified four H. cydno, three H. pachinus, and three H. melpomene individuals that 
      were of mixed ancestry. Gene genealogies revealed substantial shared DNA sequence 
      variation among all three species and coalescent simulations based on the Isolation 
      with Migration (IM) model pointed to interspecific gene flow as its cause. The IM 
      simulations further indicated that interspecific gene flow was significantly 
      asymmetrical, with greater gene flow from H. pachinus into H. cydno (2Nm = 4.326) 
      than the reverse (2Nm = 0.502), and unidirectional gene flow from H. cydno and H. 
      pachinus into H. melpomene (2Nm = 0.294 and 0.252, respectively). These asymmetries 
      are in the directions expected based on the genetics of wing patterning and the 
      probability that hybrids of various phenotypes will survive and reproduce in 
      different mimetic environments. This empirical demonstration of extensive 
      interspecific gene flow is in contrast to a previous study which found little 
      evidence of gene flow between another pair of hybridizing Heliconius species, H. 
      himera and H. erato, and it highlights the critical role of natural selection in 
      maintaining species diversity. Furthermore, these results lend support to the 
      hypotheses that phenotypic diversification in the genus Heliconius has been fueled 
      by introgressive hybridization and that reinforcement has driven the evolution of 
      assortative mate preferences.

TI  - The lycaenid butterfly Polyommatus icarus uses a duplicated blue opsin to see green.
PG  - 361-9
LID - 10.1242/jeb.012617 [doi]
AB  - The functional significance of gene duplication is rarely addressed at the level of 
      animal behavior. Butterflies are excellent models in this regard because they can be 
      trained and the use of their opsin-based visual pigments in color vision can be 
      assessed. In the present study, we demonstrate that the lycaenid Polyommatus icarus 
      uses its duplicate blue (B2) opsin, BRh2, in conjunction with its long-wavelength 
      (LW) opsin, LWRh, to see color in the green part of the light spectrum extending up 
      to 560 nm. This is in contrast to butterflies in the genus Papilio, which use 
      duplicate LW opsins to discriminate colors in the long-wavelength range. We also 
      found that P. icarus has a heterogeneously expressed red filtering pigment and 
      red-reflecting ommatidia in the ventral eye region. In behavioural tests, the 
      butterflies could not discriminate colors in the red range (570-640 nm). This 
      finding is significant because we have previously found that the nymphalid butterfly 
      Heliconius erato has filter-pigment mediated color vision in the long wavelength 
      range. Our results suggest that lateral filtering pigments may not always influence 
      color vision in insects.

TI  - The major indole alkaloid N,β-D-glucopyranosyl vincosamide from leaves of Psychotria 
      leiocarpa Cham. & Schltdl. is not an antifeedant but shows broad antioxidant 
      activity.
PG  - 402-11
LID - 10.1080/14786419.2012.715293 [doi]
AB  - N,β-D-glucopyranosyl vincosamide (GPV), a major alkaloid of Psychotria leiocarpa, 
      constitutes up to 2.5% of the dry weight in leaves. Alkaloid content was not 
      elicited by mechanical wounding or jasmonate. At concentrations found in natural 
      conditions or 2.5 fold higher, GPV did not inhibit herbivory in two unrelated 
      generalist models (Helix aspersa and Spodoptera frugiperda) or in a specific 
      interaction model (Heliconius erato fed with Passiflora suberosa). In situ staining 
      assay showed quenching activity of hydrogen peroxide by GPV. Exposure of P. 
      leiocarpa to acute UV-B stress did not change GPV or chlorophyll content, indicating 
      high tolerance to this stress by the species. In vitro antioxidant tests against 
      singlet oxygen, superoxide anions and hydroxyl radicals showed efficient quenching 
      activity of the alkaloid. GPV was not effective as antifeedant, but it may act 
      indirectly in P. leiocarpa protection against oxidative stress generated upon 
      wounding, UV exposure and perhaps other environmental stresses.

TI  - Impact of duplicate gene copies on phylogenetic analysis and divergence time 
      estimates in butterflies.
PG  - 99
LID - 10.1186/1471-2148-9-99 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increase in availability of genomic sequences for a wide range of 
      organisms has revealed gene duplication to be a relatively common event. Encounters 
      with duplicate gene copies have consequently become almost inevitable in the context 
      of collecting gene sequences for inferring species trees. Here we examine the effect 
      of incorporating duplicate gene copies evolving at different rates on tree 
      reconstruction and time estimation of recent and deep divergences in butterflies. 
      RESULTS: Sequences from ultraviolet-sensitive (UVRh), blue-sensitive (BRh), and 
      long-wavelength sensitive (LWRh) opsins,EF-1 and COI were obtained from 27 taxa 
      representing the five major butterfly families (5535 bp total). Both BRh and LWRh 
      are present in multiple copies in some butterfly lineages and the different copies 
      evolve at different rates. Regardless of the phylogenetic reconstruction method 
      used, we found that analyses of combined data sets using either slower or faster 
      evolving copies of duplicate genes resulted in a single topology in agreement with 
      our current understanding of butterfly family relationships based on morphology and 
      molecules. Interestingly, individual analyses of BRh and LWRh sequences also 
      recovered these family-level relationships. Two different relaxed clock methods 
      resulted in similar divergence time estimates at the shallower nodes in the tree, 
      regardless of whether faster or slower evolving copies were used, with larger 
      discrepancies observed at deeper nodes in the phylogeny. The time of divergence 
      between the monarch butterfly Danaus plexippus and the queen D. gilippus (15.3-35.6 
      Mya) was found to be much older than the time of divergence between monarch co-mimic 
      Limenitis archippus and red-spotted purple L. arthemis (4.7-13.6 Mya), and 
      overlapping with the time of divergence of the co-mimetic passionflower butterflies 
      Heliconius erato and H. melpomene (13.5-26.1 Mya). Our family-level results are 
      congruent with recent estimates found in the literature and indicate an age of 
      84-113 million years for the divergence of all butterfly families. CONCLUSION: These 
      results are consistent with diversification of the butterfly families following the 
      radiation of angiosperms and suggest that some classes of opsin genes may be 
      usefully employed for both phylogenetic reconstruction and divergence time 
      estimation.

TI  - ESTIMATING THE MATING BEHAVIOR OF A PAIR OF HYBRIDIZING HELICONIUS SPECIES IN THE 
      WILD.
PG  - 503-510

AB  - Premating isolation between incipient species is rarely studied in nature, even 
      though mating tests in captivity may give an inaccurate picture of natural 
      hybridization. We studied premating barriers between the warningly colored 
      butterflies Heliconius erato and H. himera (Lepidoptera) in a narrow contact zone in 
      Ecuador, where hybrids are found at low frequency. Eggs obtained from wild-mated 
      females, supplemented with eggs and young larvae collected from the wild, were 
      reared to adulthood. Adult color patterns of these progeny were then used to infer 
      how their parents must have mated. Likelihood was used to estimate both the 
      frequencies of potential parental genotypes from adult phenotypes collected in the 
      wild, and the degree of assortative mating from the inferred parents. The 
      frequencies of parental genotypes varied across the hybrid zone, but our statistical 
      method allowed estimates of hybrid deficit and assortative mating to be integrated 
      across all sites sampled. The best estimate of the frequency of F(1) and backcross 
      hybrid adults in the center of the hybrid zone was 10%, with support limits (7.1%, 
      13.0%; support limits are asymptotically equivalent to 95% confidence limits). 
      Mating was highly assortative: in the center of the hybrid zone the cross-mating 
      probability between H. erato and H. himera was only 5% (0.3%, 21.4%). Wild hybrids 
      themselves mated with both pure forms, and the probabilities that they mated in any 
      direction were not significantly lower than those among conspecifics. These results 
      are consistent with earlier laboratory studies on mate choice, and suggest that 
      selection against hybrids must be strong to prevent formation of a hybrid swarm. 
      Unfortunately, the wide support limits on mating behavior precluded a measure of the 
      strength of selection from these data alone. Our statistical approach provides a 
      useful general method for estimating mate choice in the wild.

TI  - Absence of crossing-over in female butterflies (Heliconius).
PG  - 265-9
AB  - Absence of recombination between linked markers in female Heliconius is suggested by 
      coupling backcross broods in H. erato, by a repulsion F2 in H. melpomene, and by 
      other crosses with this species. No recombinants have been found in the offspring of 
      doubly heterozygous females in either species. This supports the contention that the 
      absence of chiasmata at oogenesis in these bufferflies prevents genetic 
      crossing-over. Chiasmata are absent in all the female Lepidoptera examined by 
      Suomalainen and others, but Ephestia seems to show the absence of chiasmata but the 
      presence of genetic recombination in the female, and therefore would repay further 
      study.

TI  - Ants visit nectaries of Epidendrum denticulatum (Orchidaceae) in a Brazilian 
      rainforest: effects on herbivory and pollination.
PG  - 551-8
AB  - Epidendrum denticulatum (Orchidaceae) produces nectar on the petioles of buds, 
      flowers, and fruits (extrafloral nectaries) but no nectar is found on its flowers, 
      and it is probably a deceptive species. In the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest, some 
      aspects of both the ecology and behavior of Camponotus sericeiventris (Formicinae) 
      and Ectatomma tuberculatum (Ponerinae), two ant species foraging on E. denticulatum 
      extrafloral nectaries, were investigated. Both experiments, using termites as baits 
      and field observations, suggest that these ant species are able to prevent 
      reproductive organ herbivory, without affecting pollinator behaviour. Since a low 
      fruit set is often cited as a characteristic of the family, especially for deceptive 
      species, ants attracted to orchid inflorescences protect reproductive structures and 
      increase the probability of pollination success. Epidendrum denticulatum flowers 
      were visited and probably pollinated by Heliconius erato (Nymphalidae) and Euphyes 
      leptosema (Hesperiidae).

TI  - Contrasted modes of evolution in the same genome: allozymes and adaptive change in 
      Heliconius.
PG  - 1924-8
AB  - Butterflies in the South American genus Heliconius have undergone a spectacular 
      adaptive radiation (with convergent evolution between some lines) in their color 
      patterns; this has been produced by natural selection for muellerian mimicry. The 
      genetic basis of this radiation, shown by crossing highly differentiated races 
      within two of the species, is homozygosity for alternative alleles at some half 
      dozen loci. In complete contrast, allozyme loci in these butterflies are strongly 
      heterozygous and show only frequency differences (never amounting to homozygosity of 
      alternative alleles) between races; the amount of allozyme divergence is the same 
      between races of H. erato and H. sara, although in color pattern the first forms 
      marked races and the other does not. For the allozymes, there is a strong 
      correlation over loci for rate of divergence between species and average 
      heterozygosity. This is not true of the genes controlling color pattern. 
      Heterozygosity of the enzymes is correlated with subunit molecular weight. Thus, 
      different parts of the genome can evolve in different ways simultaneously; genes 
      controlling color pattern in the "classical" mode, and allozymes in a different mode 
      in which the rate of evolution is related to their heterozygosity (a "balance" or 
      "neutral" mode).

      three model lepidopteran species.

LID - 10.1186/1471-2164-10-283 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Manduca sexta, Heliothis virescens, and Heliconius erato represent three 
      widely-used insect model species for genomic and fundamental studies in Lepidoptera. 
      Large-insert BAC libraries of these insects are critical resources for many 
      molecular studies, including physical mapping and genome sequencing, but not 
      available to date. RESULTS: We report the construction and characterization of six 
      large-insert BAC libraries for the three species and sampling sequence analysis of 
      the genomes. The six BAC libraries were constructed with two restriction enzymes, 
      two libraries for each species, and each has an average clone insert size ranging 
      from 152-175 kb. We estimated that the genome coverage of each library ranged from 
      6-9 x, with the two combined libraries of each species being equivalent to 13.0-16.3 
      x haploid genomes. The genome coverage, quality and utility of the libraries were 
      further confirmed by library screening using 6 approximately 8 putative single-copy 
      probes. To provide a first glimpse into these genomes, we sequenced and analyzed the 
      BAC ends of approximately 200 clones randomly selected from the libraries of each 
      species. The data revealed that the genomes are AT-rich, contain relatively small 
      fractions of repeat elements with a majority belonging to the category of low 
      complexity repeats, and are more abundant in retro-elements than DNA transposons. 
      Among the species, the H. erato genome is somewhat more abundant in repeat elements 
      and simple repeats than those of M. sexta and H. virescens. The BLAST analysis of 
      the BAC end sequences suggested that the evolution of the three genomes is widely 
      varied, with the genome of H. virescens being the most conserved as a typical 
      lepidopteran, whereas both genomes of H. erato and M. sexta appear to have evolved 
      significantly, resulting in a higher level of species- or evolutionary 
      lineage-specific sequences. CONCLUSION: The high-quality and large-insert BAC 
      libraries of the insects, together with the identified BACs containing genes of 
      interest, provide valuable information, resources and tools for comprehensive 
      understanding and studies of the insect genomes and for addressing many fundamental 
      questions in Lepidoptera. The sample of the genomic sequences provides the first 
      insight into the constitution and evolution of the insect genomes.

TI  - The wave speed of intergradation zone in two-species lattice Müllerian mimicry 
      model.
PG  - 594-603
AB  - A spatially explicit model is studied to analyse the movement of coupled clines in 
      two-species Müllerian mimicry system as exemplified by the comimicking helicoiine 
      butterflies in Central-South America Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene. In 
      this system, a pair of comimicking wing patterns of two species (mimicry ring) is 
      found in a geographical region but another pair of wing patterns is found in a 
      different geographical region. The distribution of mimicry rings thus forms a 
      spatial mosaic in a large geographical scale, and the mechanism responsible for 
      their stable maintenance has been a long-standing question in evolutionary biology. 
      We here examine the speed of the movement of boundaries that divide the regions 
      inhabited by different mimetic morphs in each comimicking species, by assuming 
      coupled two-state stochastic cellular automatons where the flipping rate of the site 
      occupied by a mimetic morph depends on the local density of the same morph and of 
      the comimicking morph in the other species. The speed of cline movement shows a 
      complex dependence on the coupling parameter between mimetic species--greater 
      coupling of comimicking morphs between species slows down the cline movement only 
      when the reduction in predation rate exhibits diminishing return to the increase of 
      local mimetic morph density. The analytical predictions are confirmed by the results 
      of Monte Carlo simulations. The speed of advance is quite different from that 
      predicted from the conventional reaction-diffusion model, indicating that 
      demographic stochasticity plays a critical role in determining the speed of cline 
      movement. We also examine if the spatial heterogeneity in migration rate can stably 
      maintain clines.

TI  - Intraspecific variation in Trichogramma bruni Nagaraja, 1983 (Hymenoptera: 
      Trichogrammatidae) associated with different hosts.
PG  - 665-79
AB  - Trichogramma bruni is an insufficiently studied South American species whose limits 
      are still not well defined. Thus, the objective of the present study was to 
      characterize T. bruni taxonomically and to determine the association between 
      morphological variations as well as host and habitat, based on morphological and 
      biological studies. Specimens from the Escola Superior de Agricultura "Luiz de 
      Queiroz" (ESALQ) collection, and from the University of California Riverside (UCR) 
      and specimens collected from the vegetation of forest parks with native areas 
      planted with eucalyptus in Piracicaba and Itatinga, State of São Paulo, were also 
      analyzed. The holotype deposited at Univeridade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) 
      collection was also examined. The variability in the genital capsule of T. bruni 
      observed both among individuals of the same progeny and among specimens from 
      different hosts is remarkable and is mainly related to the dorsal lamina. Therefore, 
      an association of diagnostic characters rather than the dorsal lamina alone should 
      be used for the identification of T. bruni and intraspecific variations should be 
      considered. The intraspecific variation observed for T. bruni is a factor that 
      should be considered for its identification, since the influence of the environment 
      (habitat + host) and the variation among individuals itself is responsible for the 
      plasticity observed in the genital capsule. Heliconius erato phyllis, Hamadryas 
      feronia, Erosina hyberniata and Mechanitis lysiminia are new hosts of T. bruni.

TI  - Are chemical barriers necessary for evolution of butterfly-plant associations?
PG  - 580-583
LID - 10.1007/BF00379676 [doi]
AB  - The association between heliconiine butterflies and Passion flower vines is composed 
      of three or more subassociations, in which each Heliconius species group feeds on a 
      different Passiflora subgenus. The relationships are consistent with the adaptive 
      zone hypothesis of Ehrlich and Raven, which would suggest that (1) species of the 
      subgenus Plectostemma proliferated as a result of chemical barriers to herbivory, 
      which created a herbivore-free adaptive zone in which speciation and diversification 
      took place, and (2) species of the H. erato-charitonia group overcame these barriers 
      and entered a competitor-free adaptive zone, in which they proliferated and 
      speciated with those plants as hosts. The hypothesis that plant secondary chemicals 
      were responsible for creating such barriers to herbivory was tested using 
      heliconiine species as bioassays, in which reduced growth rates indicated presence 
      of chemical barriers to feeding. Contrary to expectation, plants of the subgenus 
      Plectostemma showed little or no chemical defense against any species of heliconiine 
      caterpillar. In contrast many plants of the "primitive" subgenus Granadilla 
      possessed significant chemical barriers against herbivory by heliconiine larvae, 
      excepting those species in the H. numata-melpomene species group. I concluded that 
      chemical barriers to feeding were not responsible for proliferation and 
      diversification in the subgenus Plectostemma, nor did chemicals create a 
      competitor-free "adaptive zone" in which the H. erato-charitonia species-group could 
      proliferate and speciate. Chemical barriers may have been important in the evolution 
      of the subgenus Granadilla-heliconiine association. I suggest that plant 
      allelochemics are only one of many possible barriers to herbivory which can help 
      create "adaptive zones" for plants and their herbivores, and that the patterns of 
      butterfly foodplant specialization discussed by Ehrlich and Raven (1964) are not 
      necessarily the result of biochemical adaptation and counteradaptation.
